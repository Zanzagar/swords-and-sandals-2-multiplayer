# Raw capture traces (ignored)

Raw JSONL instrumentation traces from controlled licensed-build sessions live
here and stay out of Git; only normalized observation records under
`test/observations/ss2-1v1/` are committed. Layout:

```text
captures/<session-id>/<observation-id>.jsonl
```

See `docs/integration/ss2-runtime-capture.md` for the session protocol and the
trace grammar. Never place original game files, extracted scripts, or
screenshots here — traces contain only independently authored numeric state,
rolls, mutations, and events.

## `ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.sha256` — the one file here that IS committed

The archive is the primary measured evidence this whole corpus is ingested
from, it is gitignored by design, and on 2026-09-01 it was measured to have
**one reachable copy**. This manifest is what makes any other copy checkable.

Regenerate or verify it from the archive root (on this machine,
`C:\ss2-capture\captures`, reachable from WSL at `/mnt/c/ss2-capture/captures`):

```bash
# verify a copy — silent means every file matches. Paths in the manifest are
# relative to the archive root, so cd there and point at the committed copy.
cd /mnt/c/ss2-capture/captures
sha256sum -c --quiet <repo>/captures/ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.sha256

# regenerate after a capture session adds traces
find . -type f -printf "%P\n" | LC_ALL=C sort | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0 sha256sum \
  > <repo>/captures/ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.sha256
```

Recorded 2026-09-19: **8,325 files, 58,492,555 bytes** — the WHOLE archive.

► **IT ATTESTED 19% OF THE ARCHIVE FOR EIGHTEEN DAYS, AND THAT IS EXACTLY THE
  STALENESS THE PARAGRAPH BELOW WARNS ABOUT.** Recorded 2026-09-01 at **1,588
  files, 18,194,754 bytes**, which was the archive then; sessions added traces
  and nobody regenerated it, so by 2026-09-19 it covered 1,588 of 8,325 files.
  **A copy could have dropped 81% of the archive and verified clean**, which is
  the one thing this file exists to make impossible. Re-measured and regenerated
  that day.

► **THE OLD ATTESTATION WAS NOT LOST, AND THAT WAS CHECKED RATHER THAN
  ASSUMED.** Before the replacement the committed manifest was verified against
  the archive and passed silently — all 1,588 files matched — and the new
  manifest is a strict SUPERSET: every one of those 1,588 lines appears in it
  verbatim, confirmed with `comm -23` over both sorted. So the regeneration
  added 6,737 files and altered nothing. **Do this check whenever you
  regenerate**, because the failure mode of a bad regeneration is a manifest
  that looks larger and attests something else:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/ss2-capture/captures
sha256sum -c --quiet <repo>/captures/ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.sha256   # old one still good?
# ... regenerate to a scratch file, then:
comm -23 <(LC_ALL=C sort <repo>/captures/ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.sha256) \
         <(LC_ALL=C sort <scratch>/ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.new) | wc -l   # must be 0
```

Regenerate it whenever a session adds traces, or the manifest silently describes
a smaller archive than the one on disk — the same staleness this project has
been bitten by elsewhere, and was bitten by here.

**Read what it does and does not prove.** It is an integrity check on bytes as
they were on 2026-09-19: it detects corruption, truncation, and partial or
failed copies, and it makes a restored backup verifiable rather than merely
present. **It is NOT a provenance claim.** It says nothing about when a trace
was captured, whether two traces came from independent sessions, or whether a
trace is genuine — a copy hashes exactly like its original, which is the whole
difficulty this corpus already has elsewhere. Do not cite it as evidence of
capture independence.

## Screenshots have a designated home, and it is NOT here

**Resolved 2026-09-01, with the owner's approval.** 15 PNG screenshots had
accumulated under `captures/auto-shots/`, which the paragraph above forbids in
plain words. They were **moved, not deleted**, to `C:\ss2-capture\ui-shots\`,
and mirrored on `D:` as `ui-shots-2026-09-01`. They are UI-navigation aids from
`ui-automation.ps1` — no trace, record or test depends on them, and nothing in
the tooling writes that path: `ui-automation.ps1 shot` takes `-Path`, so the
location was an operator choice each time.

**So put them in `ui-shots/`, never in `captures/`.** The archive should hold
only trace evidence, which is what makes a whole-archive backup free of any
game-derived imagery and what lets the manifest below mean one thing.

Recorded so the count movement is not mistaken for loss: the archive went from
1,603 files / 20,008,972 bytes to **1,588 files / 18,194,754 bytes** in the
move, and the manifest and the `D:` mirror were both regenerated and
re-verified against it afterwards.

## Sizing a backup

- **More than half the archive is regenerable**, which matters when sizing a
  backup: the 175 `DoAction.as` files are decompiled copies of this project's
  OWN wrapper, the `.swf` files are its compiled builds, and the `.jsonl` files
  are delogged from the `.rufflelog` files by
  `node tools/capture-session.mjs delog`. The irreplaceable set is the
  `.rufflelog` files plus the launcher logs, `.json` and `.sha256` — 8.7 MB raw,
  about 2.4 MB compressed, against 20 MB for the whole archive.
