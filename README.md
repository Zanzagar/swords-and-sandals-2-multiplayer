# Swords & Sandals II Multiplayer Foundation

An asset-free, independently authored foundation for bringing cooperative
multiplayer to *Swords & Sandals II*. The repository combines three related
tracks without confusing their evidence:

1. measure and reproduce selected vanilla combat behaviour;
2. build one deterministic 1v1 / 2v2 / 3v3 multiplayer architecture; and
3. design an optional Endless progression mode behind a separate rule set.

This repository contains, alters, and redistributes no original game binaries,
extracted scripts, artwork, or other licensed assets. Controlled research tools
may mutate an isolated runtime/save state while leaving installed binaries
read-only. This is not yet a finished playable mod.

## Status at a glance

| Track | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Shared team resolver | Implemented and tested for one to three combatants per team. 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 use the same resolver. |
| Vanilla parity | Partial and expanding. Promoted runtime goldens exist, but no complete runtime-verified SS2 rule set has been injected into the resolver. |
| SS2 adapter and campaign layer | Asset-free state bridge, slot layout, presentation commands, acknowledgement bridge, and additive campaign-record schema have landed. Rendering, roster read-back, rewards, and licensed-build integration remain incomplete. |
| Endless progression | Quantitatively diagnosed and specified in a research-backed design; owner decisions and readiness blockers remain open. No Endless rule set or progression implementation exists yet. |
| Online multiplayer | Deterministic foundations exist; lobby, transport, authentication, reconnect, and desync recovery are planned. |

The detailed and frequently changing delivery state lives in the
[project roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) and [current handoff](HANDOFF.md).

## What works today

- Two teams of one to three gladiators resolve through one shared engine in
  [`src/team/`](src/team). `src/engine.js` is a compatibility facade, not a
  second 1v1 implementation.
- Arbitrary targets, direct damage, damage spells, allied healing, rest,
  resources, AI fill, individual knockouts, team elimination, and once-only
  result settlement share the same event path.
- Settlement requires both team elimination and the matching final-animation
  acknowledgement; an individual knockout cannot pay a campaign result.
- Controller identity is separate from combatant and seat identity. Local,
  hot-seat, named remote, and AI controllers can coexist, and controller
  reassignment does not alter combat state.
- Those are generic engine capabilities, not the accepted Endless MVP
  admission policy. EP-D07 requires one distinct connected human per allied
  first-playable seat and forbids allied AI fill, multi-seat human control, and
  takeover; opponent AI remains allowed.
- Ordered labelled RNG, action logs, replay, JSON-safe wire projections, and
  controller-independent combat hashes provide a host-authoritative foundation.
- [`src/adapter/`](src/adapter) converts between vanilla-shaped and canonical
  state and emits inert presentation commands. Those commands have not proved a
  rendered multi-slot battle in the licensed build.
- [`src/campaign/`](src/campaign) stores a separate, versioned, additive campaign
  record. It has no path that overwrites vanilla save fields; it does not yet
  read a persistent roster back into a playable campaign or award progression.

These are repository capabilities, not proof of complete vanilla parity. The
resolver still runs an explicitly labelled placeholder rule set.

## Two rule paths, one resolver

Combat formulas and action vocabulary are injected through
[`src/team/rule-set.js`](src/team/rule-set.js). That seam keeps two future paths
separate:

- **Classic/parity path:** may reproduce only behaviour supported by the
  fingerprinted build map and promoted runtime evidence. Static reconstruction
  alone cannot claim runtime verification.
- **Endless path:** a future `endless-v0` rule set containing intentional mod
  mechanics. Before it can start, the shared rule-set contract must advance to
  v2 and require `designVersion`. Until a later verification-enum migration,
  `endless-v0` remains `placeholder` with `runtimeVerified: false`; today its
  human-readable provenance note carries designed intent. If v2 retains an
  explicit `designIntent`, it must validate, project, hash, persist, and migrate
  it. Its progression data uses a separately versioned sidecar, and it never
  reinterprets a classic fixture or golden.

Both paths may use the same team resolver, controller model, settlement gate,
and deterministic protocol. They do not share an evidence claim.

## Proposed Endless direction — design only

The current design proposes:

- four-fight **Arena Circuits** with disclosed routes, opponents, Contracts,
  and deterministic reward plans;
- a finite, versioned vertical stat and item-chassis ceiling aligned with the
  expected Emperor encounter, followed by bounded behaviour-led progression
  rather than unbounded scalar inflation; the exact ceiling remains open;
- personal **Rule Capacity** earned through eighteen authored championship
  milestones, rising from zero to a finite 48-Load ceiling across all sixteen
  mapped item positions; Team Tactic uses a separate nonfungible allowance;
- rarity based on authored rule complexity rather than strictly larger damage
  or armour numbers;
- personal inventories tied to stable combatants, with explicit co-op custody,
  binding, exchange, and crash-safe settlement rules;
- mode-neutral persistent gladiators that may enter 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 without
  resetting their Bound Soul, stats, gear, Legendary Lineages, or Tactic
  library; format and roster lock per Circuit;
- authored doctrine modules, champions, rivals, milestone bosses, and bounded
  anti-stall Arena Pressure; and
- post-100 Epoch Charters that rotate bounded challenge, opponent, and reward
  themes without raising the vertical cap.

Every proposed mechanic states whether it preserves classic combat semantics or
requires the separate designed rule set, the degenerate strategy it invites,
and the required counter/rejection test. Unless the decision record explicitly
accepts one—as it now does for EP-D02's named milestone order, grant cadence,
costs, hosts, and 48 ceiling—names, rates, caps, unlocks, and balance thresholds
remain design assumptions until approved and tested.

The pending first-proof proposal is a deterministic 2v2, four-fight Contract
loop. EP-D07 already requires every allied seat in any first playable version
to have a distinct connected human, with action-boundary pause and same-seat
reconnect instead of allied AI fill or takeover. Before code, each of the seven
product decisions and EP-A01–EP-A03 must be accepted or superseded by a fully
normative, explicitly accepted replacement; EP-D01, EP-D02, and EP-D07 are
closed while EP-D03–EP-D06 remain pending. Rejection or an open revision
remains blocking.
EP-D07's accepted corrected dropout supplement makes its grace period visible at Circuit
entry: expiry never abandons automatically, but can activate an absent member's
narrow pre-consent while every connected teammate must approve the existing
atomic Concede receipt. A reconnect restores only that member, so a
multiple-dropout battle stays paused until every required ally returns; any
resulting Recovery retains its original roster and human-seat requirements.
The readiness audit also found three P0 model questions that approval alone
does not close—career/challenge pacing, deterministic retry/seed shopping, and
post-completion maintenance access—plus missing designed-combat budgets and an
incomplete Pressure termination proof, and one incompatible JSON/u64
persistence claim. Rule-contract v2, sidecar/snapshot, or `endless-v0` code
remains blocked until their selected repairs/specifications are normative.
Headless and playable proofs have different final gates; playable work also
needs a real per-action animation acknowledgement signal plus a genuine
multi-human admission, pause, reconnect, grace-timer, and race-safe abandonment
protocol implementing that accepted authority rule.

## Evidence vocabulary

| Label | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime-observed / promoted golden | The promotion gate requires at least two matching qualifying records with distinct declared session IDs for the fingerprinted build. Runtime origin and process independence additionally depend on the documented operating procedure; the repository cannot prove them by itself. A golden supports that fixture, not the whole game. |
| Byte-mapped | Read from the fingerprinted build's static control flow or data. It is stronger than recollection but is not automatically a runtime observation. |
| Derived | Mathematics or conclusions calculated from mapped or observed inputs. The derivation may be exact even when its domain remains incomplete. |
| Designed / assumed | An intentional mod mechanic or tuning hypothesis. Combat changes to vocabulary, legality, outcomes, RNG, AI, or stacking require the separate designed rule set; campaign routes, rewards, inventory, custody, persistence, and content-only Contracts may live outside combat behind their stated seams. |
| Unverified | A claim, interaction, or curve for which the current repository does not carry adequate evidence. |

## Run the verification suite

```powershell
npm test
```

There are no package dependencies. If Node is installed but the `npm` launcher
is unavailable, run the package test entry directly:

```powershell
node --test
```

## Licensed-build and contributor boundary

- Keep licensed binaries, saves, and raw capture traces outside version control.
  Normalized, asset-free observation records are committed evidence.
- Never copy, export, commit, or redistribute original game or third-party mod
  source/assets. Research may describe and cite other mods; it may not vendor
  them.
- Runtime capture is a controlled, save-sensitive workflow. Only one Ruffle
  session may touch a save at a time; a second session can flush stale state and
  silently overwrite the first session's progress.
- Read the [current handoff safety items](HANDOFF.md#open-items) before any
  capture work. Some scripts and runbook premises are explicitly still unsafe
  or stale. Use the dedicated
  [runtime-capture documentation](docs/integration/ss2-runtime-capture.md) and
  [staging runbook](docs/integration/ss2-staging-runbook.md) only together with
  those current warnings; never launch capture tools casually.
- Distributable work is limited to independently authored source, metadata,
  fixtures, documentation, and patches.
