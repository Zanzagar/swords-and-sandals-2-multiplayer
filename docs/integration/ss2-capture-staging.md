# SS2 capture staging guide

How to stage each committed candidate's scenario in the licensed build for a
controlled capture session (protocol in
[the runtime-capture workflow](ss2-runtime-capture.md)). Every staged value
must be reached through normal play or supported game state — the installed
build is never modified, and `battlevalues` rederives derived stats every
phase, so only derivable states are stageable.

This document answers one question per fixture: **what has to be set up before
a capture of this can even happen?** It is not the capture procedure; that is
the runtime-capture workflow, and it is not the command line either; that is
[the staging runbook](ss2-staging-runbook.md).

## What has superseded parts of this page

This is the oldest planning document in the project. It was written before the
arena route existed, before scenario staging existed, and before the item and
champion tables were decoded, and three of its central conclusions have since
been overturned by work in other documents. Where that has happened the old
reasoning is kept and marked rather than deleted, because the reasoning was
usually sound and only its premise moved.

| This page used to say | Now | Where it was settled |
| --- | --- | --- |
| villain-side armour is not stageable, so most of Groups C–F are blocked | `-StageVillain` overwrites every projected villain key before the action arms | [runbook §0](ss2-staging-runbook.md), verified again below |
| `fight_mode == "tournament"` has never been observed live | reached live, and recorded 40 times in the arena captures | [arena route §3, §12](ss2-arena-route.md) |
| neither duel candidate has a route to the two-observation gate | reachable in principle — staging overrides the generator | [runbook §9](ss2-staging-runbook.md) |
| mid-battle armour wear needs an extra uncontrolled exchange | directly stageable; the refill sits behind a `battle_started` guard | [runbook §0.3](ss2-staging-runbook.md) |
| the spell trace carries no `spell_id` | the wrapper emits it; the blocker is now the missing `magic-damage` event | [runbook §10](ss2-staging-runbook.md) |
| a tournament loss ends the character | false — no flush site is reachable from a bout, the ladder or the loss path | [arena route §3, §12](ss2-arena-route.md) |
| `run-arena.ps1` cannot pass `-WatchFields` | it can, and it is the only save-guarded vehicle that also stages | its own `param()` block, re-read here |
| the wrapper has no attacker-side gate | it has one, and the gate is **dead** — it reads a path the game never writes | this revision, *Direction attrition* under Group H |
| the fifteen impossible-hero fixtures fail an exhaustive weapon search | they fail a **proof** — the damage spread is strength-free and pins one weapon row | this revision, *The weapon spread is a table lookup* |
| snapshots are a procedure the operator has to remember | `run-arena.ps1` snapshots itself, and `save-state.ps1` refuses a damaged save in **both** directions | this revision, *What a session costs* |

**And one thing this page got right that later documents did not.** The
derivation constraint below has always read `round(strength * 2) + weapon_min`.
Several other documents dropped the factor of two. The bytes are
`Push register:3, "strength"; GetMember; Push 2; Multiply; Math.round; Push
register:3, "weapon_min_damage"; GetMember; Add2` at `battlevalues` `+0x3356`
(`root/frame:35/DoAction@0x3fa9dc`), re-read for this revision. The factor is 2.
The **secondary** pair at `+0x33b6`/`+0x33e6` uses 1, which is probably where
the confusion started.

## How to read the evidence column

Every table below carries an evidence marker, because the ~~twenty-two~~
**twenty-three** promoted goldens make it possible to separate what has actually been staged from what
the map says should be stageable.

| Marker | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **verified** | the staging was reached in a real capture session against the licensed build; the observed values are recorded in `test/observations/ss2-1v1/` |
| **inferred** | derived from a cited section of [the battle map](ss2-battle-map.md) or the statically read controller vocabulary; never observed |
| **open** | not determined by either; the row says what evidence would settle it |

**What "verified" does and does not cover.** A capture observes the ordered
mutation trace, the semantic events (hit or miss, and which `defender_hurt`
method was dispatched), the result event, the staged and final state dumps,
`attack_direction`, `fight_mode`, and the *number* of `randomBetween` draws in
the armed window. It does **not** observe any roll's bounds or value. The
wrapper's tap sits on `Math.random`, which receives no arguments, so every
`roll` line in a trace is echoed from the tape that session injected — and the
tape was generated from the fixture under test, so the sample comparison
compares a fixture against a copy of itself and can only fail on the count
(runtime-capture §What a match actually establishes). A **verified** row here
therefore means the staging was reached and the observed channels agreed. It
never means an injected bound or value was measured.

Build-behaviour claims cite the battle map by section heading rather than line
number, because that document is under concurrent revision. Claims about the
route *to* a fight — which screens, which fight modes, which opponents — cite
[the leveled-gladiator arena route](ss2-arena-route.md) by numbered section in
the same way; those were byte-read there and are not independently re-decoded
here.

## Derivation constraints (from the verified `battlevalues` map)

| Staged field | Constraint | Stageable? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `min_damage` / `max_damage` | `round(strength * 2) + weapon_min/max_damage` (`+0x3356`, `+0x3386`) | **no** — an output. Stage `strength` and `weapon` |
| `weapon_min/max_damage` | `_root["weapon" + <side>.weapon][3]` and `[4]` (`+0x31be`, `+0x31da`) | **no** — a table lookup. `weapon` (the id) is the input |
| `hitpointsmax` | `herolevel * 10 + vitality * 20` (`+0x378e`) | **no** — stage `herolevel` and `vitality` |
| `staminamax` | `100 + stamina * 10` (`+0x37b6`) | **no** — stage `stamina` |
| `armourclass_max` | sum of `round(piece * multiplier)` over equipped pieces (breastplate 16, helmet 10, shinguard 6, greaves 3, shoulderguard 8, gauntlet 5, boot 2, shield 12; shield counts 0 while `using_bow`) | **yes mid-battle** — see below |
| `armourclass < armourclass_max` | **now directly stageable** | **yes** |
| `hitpoints < hitpointsmax` | `check_stats` clamps down only, so a value below max survives | **yes**, but the defeat-gate consequence below still binds the fight mode |

The multipliers are `_global.<piece>_dval` literals at `battlevalues`
`+0x3089`–`+0x30f0`, re-read for this revision: 16, 10, 6, 3, 8, 5, 2, 12 in
the order above. The rest of the table comes from map §Combatant state objects.

**Correction — mid-battle armour wear is no longer an engineering problem.**
This section used to say that `armourclass < armourclass_max` was "reachable
only mid-battle (take armour damage first; refills happen while
`battle_started` is false)". The premise was right and the conclusion no longer
follows. The refill block is guarded:

```text
+0x3a90  if (_global.battle_started == true) goto +0x3c0d   // skips 360 bytes
+0x3aa5  hitpoints       = round(hitpointsmax)
+0x3ac3  armourclass_max = <the eight *_defence values summed>
+0x3b0f  armourclass     = armourclass_max
```

and `stepStaging` writes only while `_global.battle_started == true`, i.e. past
the guard. So `armourclass` and `armourclass_max` are never re-derived after
staging, and a staged `armourclass 12` of `armourclass_max 16` survives every
`nextphase` for the rest of the bout. The corollary matters: because the sum is
**not** recomputed mid-battle, staging the raw pieces alone does nothing to the
absorbing pool — stage `armourclass` and `armourclass_max` explicitly, alongside
the pieces. Byte detail and command lines in
[runbook §0.3](ss2-staging-runbook.md).

The one thing that *does* still touch these mid-battle is `check_stats`, and it
only ever clamps **down**: re-read for this revision at overlay `+0x110a`
onward, it forces `staminaleft` into `[0, staminamax]`, `hitpoints` into
`[0, hitpointsmax]` and `armourclass` into `[0, armourclass_max]`, never
raising anything. It has eleven call sites, two of which decide the question —
`nextphase` calls it on every phase transition, and `damagecharacter` calls it
one instruction before the defeat gate. So a staged value *below* its ceiling
is safe and a staged value *above* it is not: `hitpoints 999` survives until
the next transition and then becomes `hitpointsmax`. Stage inputs, not outputs.

Common implied builds in the committed fixtures:

- `staminamax 100`: stamina stat 0; `staminamax 110`: stamina stat 1;
  `staminamax 150`: stamina stat 5.
- `hitpointsmax 40` = level 2 / vitality 1; `50` = level 3 / vitality 1 (or
  level 1 / vitality 2); `60` = level 2 / vitality 2 (or level 4 / vitality 1);
  `300` = level 4 / vitality 13.
- The tutorial pair: hero `30` = level 1 / vitality 1; prisoner `10` =
  level 1 / vitality 0.

### The weapon spread is a table lookup, and one implied weapon does not exist

This section used to say, of the legacy fixtures, "strength 5 with
`min 12 / max 20`, or strength 9 with `min 20 / max 28`: a 2/10-damage weapon in
both cases." **The arithmetic is right and the weapon is not real.**

`_root.weapon0` … `_root.weapon80` plus nine off-shop rows are 90 authored
`Array` literals in `root/frame:35/DoAction@0x3fa9dc` (`+0x3dee`–`+0x4c9c`);
[the item tables](ss2-item-tables.md) decodes all of them, and the numeric
`[3]`/`[4]` columns were re-read from the bytes for this revision. **No row in
the build has `[3] = 2` with `[4] = 10`.** The closest is `weapon41`, `4 / 12`,
whose spread of 8 is the same — so `min 12 / max 20` is producible, but only at
`strength` **4**, and `min 20 / max 28` only at `strength` **8**.

**Upgraded — this is now a proof, not a failed search.** The earlier revision
said only that no matching row *was found*, which is the weaker claim a reader
is entitled to distrust: a search can miss a row. Three facts close it, and all
three were re-read for this revision.

1. **The damage spread is strength-free.** `battlevalues` writes the two fields
   with the identical leading term — `+0x3356` is
   `min_damage = Math.round(strength * 2) + weapon_min_damage` and `+0x3386` is
   `max_damage = Math.round(strength * 2) + weapon_max_damage`, both in
   `root/frame:35/DoAction@0x3fa9dc`, both `Push register:3, "strength";
   GetMember; Push 2; Multiply; Math.round; … Add2; SetMember`. Subtracting,
   `max_damage − min_damage = weapon[4] − weapon[3]` exactly, for every
   gladiator, at every strength. So the spread a fixture asserts *names the
   weapon row* on its own, before strength is considered at all.
2. **Exactly one row in ninety has spread 8.** Counted over all 90 authored
   `Array` literals — the 80 shop ids of item tables §2.3 plus the 10 off-shop
   rows of §2.4 (`0`, `201`–`207`, `210`, `220`) — the only `[4] − [3] = 8` is
   `weapon41` (bashing 1, `4 / 12`, gate `strength >= 3`). The fifteen fixtures
   assert `12 / 20` and `20 / 28`, both of spread 8, so `weapon41` is not the
   closest candidate: it is the **only** one, and the fixtures' strengths then
   contradict it directly (`12 = round(2s) + 4` gives `s = 4`, not 5;
   `20 = round(2s) + 4` gives `s = 8`, not 9).
3. **Staging cannot escape the contradiction either.** `min_damage` and
   `max_damage` are outputs, and `nextphase` recomputes them for **both**
   combatants at every phase transition: `sprite:862[overlay]/frame:52/
   DoAction@0x240c7f` calls `battlevalues(game_attacker)` at `+0x35eb`/`+0x35f1`
   and `battlevalues(game_defender)` at `+0x35ff`/`+0x3605`, on the straight-line
   path (the `If` at `+0x35d5` jumps *to* `+0x35eb`, so neither call sits inside
   the branch). Every approach walk is a phase transition, so a staged
   `min_damage` is gone several times over before the action arms. There is no
   staging string, no shop purchase and no snapshot that satisfies both members
   of the pair at once.

Both `strength` and `min_damage` are projected fields, so a fixture asserting
`strength 5` **and** `min_damage 12` cannot be satisfied by any weapon id, by
any staging, in this build — and now for a reason that does not depend on
having looked at every row. **Fifteen uncaptured candidates carry that pair** —
every legacy physical candidate outside the duel, armoured, tournament and
champion families. They are marked below and the fix is a fixture edit, not a
staging plan.

For contrast, every other uncaptured family's implied weapon *does* exist:

| Family | Implied `[3]/[4]` | Weapon id |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate-armoured-*`, `candidate-tournament-*` (hero, strength 10, 21/23) | 1 / 3 | **`weapon0`**, the starting weapon — do not shop |
| `candidate-champion-*` (hero, strength 30, 68/92) | 8 / 32 | **24** (hacking, gate `strength >= 12`) |
| `candidate-champion-*` (villain, strength 6, 20/44) | 8 / 32 | **24** — the champion's own DNA index 13 |
| `candidate-duel-*` (hero, strength 7, 18/26) | 4 / 12 | **41** (bashing, gate `strength >= 3`) |
| `candidate-duel-absorbed-normal-hit` (villain, strength 2, 8/16) | 4 / 12 | **41** |
| `candidate-duel-firstblood-normal-kill` (villain, strength 2, 8/20) | 4 / 16 | **2**, **21** or **61** (61 is on no shop page; for a staged villain that does not matter) |

**That table is a derivation, not a list of guesses, and the spread is what
derives it.** Because `max − min` is strength-free, every row above is found by
looking up one number. Over all 90 authored rows there are 55 distinct spreads,
of which 30 name exactly one weapon — and every spread these fixtures need
falls in that set or resolves to a short list: spread **2** is `weapon0` alone,
spread **8** is `weapon41` alone, spread **24** is `weapon24` alone, and spread
**12** is exactly `{2, 21, 61}`, which is precisely the three-way choice the
last row already names. The ids in this table were originally derived a
different way and land on the same answers, which is the cross-check worth
having. Use the spread first whenever a new fixture's weapon has to be
identified; the strength then either confirms the row or falsifies the fixture,
as it does for the fifteen.

A fixture only stages the fields it names, and `capture-session.mjs ingest`
projects an observation onto exactly those fields
(`Object.keys(fixture.scenario.hero)` / `.villain`, `src/golden/capture-ingest.js`).
An unstaged armour piece is therefore not compared: a villain block that stages
`armourclass_max 12` with no piece fields can be satisfied by boot 6, greaves 4,
or shield 1 — whichever the available gladiator happens to wear. That same
projection rule is what makes the duel pair reachable again; see Villain-side
staging.

### The two shop gates, precisely

Both were mis-stated in this project's earlier documents, in opposite
directions.

- **Weapons are attribute-gated, never level-gated.** `weaponbuttons` writes
  `item.itemlevel = weap_i * 3` and `item.attribute_required = hero.speed`
  (ids 1–20 slashing, 61–80 ranged) or `hero.strength` (21–40 hacking, 41–60
  bashing); the `onRelease` gate refuses when `itemlevel > attribute_required`.
  So the real gate is **`3 * band_position <= hero.speed`** or
  **`<= hero.strength`**. `herolevel` appears nowhere in the function. Re-read
  for this revision at `sprite:1961/frame:1/DoAction@0x6110ce` `+0x05e7`
  (attribute), `+0x061e` (`* 3`).
- **Armour is level-gated.** `armourbuttons`' `onRelease` at
  `sprite:1909/frame:1/DoAction@0x5f1fa9` `+0x0b77` compares
  `item.itemlevel > _root.game.hero.herolevel` and takes the refusal arm; so
  the gate is **`itemlevel <= herolevel`**, and armour `itemlevel` is a step
  function of the item number, not `n * 3` (2–4 → 1, 5–6 → 6, 7–9 → 12, …).
  A level 4–5 gladiator can buy item numbers 2, 3 and 4 and nothing else.

Both re-read from the bytes for this revision; the full tables, costs and the
two dead `game_mode == "demo"` refusals are in
[the item tables](ss2-item-tables.md).

## The defeat gate makes most legacy candidates tournament-only

The byte-verified defeat gate (map §Defeat gate and death dispatch) is entered
when `hitpoints <= 0` **or** (`hitpoints < hitpointsmax` **and**
`fight_mode != "tournament"`). The staging consequence, which the earlier
version of this document did not record:

- **Any hit that reaches hitpoints ends a non-tournament fight.** The first
  live captures confirmed this directly for `duel` (map §Defeat gate,
  runtime-resolved note): the fight ends via `death(clip, "yield")` on the
  first hitpoint damage, and a fully armour-absorbed hit does not trigger it.
- The same term covers `misc`, the tutorial prisoner fight's mode, because the
  test is `!= "tournament"`. That is **inferred** from the byte-verified gate;
  every prisoner capture so far has been outright lethal, so the first-blood
  branch has never fired in `misc`.
- Therefore a fixture that applies hitpoint damage and expects **no** result
  event is only reachable in a genuine tournament fight. **Twelve** of the
  legacy physical candidates are in exactly that position, and four of the
  spell candidates; the newer `candidate-armoured-*`, `candidate-tournament-*`
  and `candidate-champion-*` families all stage `fightMode: "tournament"`
  explicitly. (An earlier revision said thirteen physical. Thirteen is the
  count of *tournament-only* legacy physical candidates; the thirteenth,
  `candidate-lethal-result`, is tournament-only for a different reason — it
  stages a defender already at `hitpoints 12` of `40`, which is the gate's
  second term satisfied before the action even begins, so in any other mode
  the bout would already have ended. Note that the *staging* of that state is
  no longer the problem it was: `check_stats` clamps down only, so
  `hitpoints:12` sticks. None of the ten probe candidates is in either set:
  their hit arms kill outright and their miss arms touch nothing.)
- **Corrected — `fight_mode == "tournament"` is no longer unobserved, and it is
  no longer a blocker for anything.** This section used to read "has never been
  observed live"; that was true when it was written and the sentence was left
  standing after the arena route made the mode cheap. It is now reached
  routinely: a level-4 gladiator with `current_tournament == 1` qualifies for a
  four-fighter tournament in arena 2 (arena route §3), and **40 capture lines
  across fifteen logs in `captures/arena-tourn-2`, `arena-tourn-dry`,
  `arena-staged-1`, `arena-staged-2` and `arena-champ-1` read
  `"fightMode":"tournament"` off `_global` at root frame 220**, against 13
  `duel` and 136 `misc`. Treat any row below that says "needs a tournament" as
  a routing requirement, not an unknown.

  ~~The narrower claim that *is* still true: **no ingested observation records
  the mode yet.** All 67 observations under `test/observations/ss2-1v1/` read
  `misc` (66) or `duel` (1), because ingest projects `fight_mode` only when the
  fixture stages it and no tournament-mode fixture has been captured. The first
  successful tournament capture retires that gap for free.~~

  ► **CORRECTED 2026-09-07: the gap is CLOSED, and closing it is what the
  paragraph predicted.** There are now **69** observations under
  `test/observations/ss2-1v1/` — 66 `misc`, 1 `duel` and **2 `tournament`**
  (`obs-onx1405-a1` and `obs-onx1521-a1`, both 2026-09-02, both cited by
  `golden-armoured-deflection-threshold-cleared`). Re-derive with
  `grep -ho '"fightMode"[^,}]*' test/observations/ss2-1v1/*.json | sort | uniq -c`.
  The mode IS recorded in an ingested observation; the "first successful
  tournament capture" happened and did retire the gap for free.

Armour damage does not enter the gate, so mid-battle armour wear
(`armourclass < armourclass_max`) is stageable in any mode.

A fixture that omits `scenario.fightMode` is not asserting the live mode —
ingest only projects `fight_mode` when the fixture stages it. The mode still
binds indirectly, through the result event the capture would or would not
observe.

## The staged fight that produced the goldens (verified)

`run-capture.ps1 -Navigate prisoner` walks the game from its title screen to
the tutorial prisoner battle using the build's own navigation calls, loading
the hero from a saved gladiator slot. Everything below was observed in the
sessions behind `test/fixtures/ss2-1v1-golden/`:

| Staged fact | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| Fight mode | `misc` (set with `current_arena = 1` at sprite 1788 frame 78 — map §Battle entry and timeline ownership) |
| Hero weapon mode | `equipped_weapon = 1`, `using_bow = false`, forced by the arena construction action (map §Battle entry) |
| Hero (saved slot) | hp 30/30, armour 0/0, strength 10, attack/defence/charisma/magicka 1, damage 21–23, stamina 105/110 at action time |
| Villain (prisoner) | hp 10/10, armour 0/0, every stat 0, damage 1–3, stamina 95/100 at action time |
| Status flags | all `undefined` on the persistent objects until something sets them; the wrapper normalizes them to `false` (map §Combatant state objects) |
| Autopilot | `walkright*5,normal_attack` — five walks carry the hero from `longrange_warrior` into `closerange_warrior`, where the three melee labels live |
| Stamina drift | hero 110 → 105, villain 100 → 95 — **both measured, neither derived.** The hero's five walks do not explain the villain's −5, and the bytes forbid the derivation this row used to give. See the correction below |
| Attack direction | **observed, not forced** — drawn before the recording window arms, so a family needs one candidate per direction |

**Corrected — the hero's walks cannot move the villain's stamina.** The stamina
row used to read *"the five walks cost stamina: 110 → 105 hero, 100 → 95
villain"*, deriving both numbers from the hero's autopilot. Re-read from the
bytes for this revision, in `nextphase` (overlay
`sprite:862[overlay]/frame:52/DoAction@0x240c7f`, function defined at `+0x3193`):

```text
+0x32a1..+0x32c2  game_attacker.staminaleft -= game_attacker.staminacost
+0x32c3..+0x3304  game_attacker.staminaleft += 1 + Math.round(game_attacker.stamina / 3)
+0x3347           check_stats(game_attacker)
```

Both writes target `game_attacker` and nothing else. Of the build's 43
`staminacost` references, one is the read at `+0x32bb` above and the other 42
are writes, every one of them of the form `game_attacker.staminacost = …`
(`+0x3b37` is the walk: `Math.round(movement_speed / 2)`).

`staminaleft` itself has 42 references build-wide, and censusing every one of
them settles the question outright — **`+0x32a7` is the only write in the build
that decreases `staminaleft`, and it is charged to `game_attacker`.** Every
other write raises it or pins it:

| Site | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `check_stats` `+0x1122` / `+0x114b` | clamp to `staminamax`, floor at `0` |
| `nextphase` `+0x32c9` | `+= 1 + Math.round(stamina / 3)` |
| `nextphase` `+0x349b` | `+= Math.round(staminamax / 4)`, behind `spell_boundless_energy > 0` |
| `+0x521d`, `+0x5af7`, `+0x5b9a`, `+0x6894` | `+= bonus` |
| `damagecharacter` `+0x1928`, `magic_damage_character` `+0x14cc` | `+= ceil(damage × breastplate / 100)` on the character **taking** the hit — `0` for a bare combatant |
| `+0x8e1d`, `battlevalues` `+0x3b38` (only when already `<= 0`) | `= staminamax` |
| `sprite:2249/frame:1` `+0x0b9c` | `_root.game.villain.staminaleft = staminamax` — villain only |
| `sprite:862[overlay]/frame:62` `+0x01a4` | `_root.game.hero.staminaleft = staminamax` — hero only |

The rest are reads: the stamina bars and their tooltips (overlay frames 5 and
20, `sprite:751[combat_panel]`), the hero's `rest`-phase test at overlay frame 1
`+0x0d2e`, and three villain-AI tests — `villain_cast_spells` `+0x0a5a` (drink a
potion below half `staminamax`), and `+0x03e8` / `+0x0b33` in the villain
decision block `DoAction@0x23f835` (act at all only above `10`; choose `rest`
below 40%). **No write anywhere lets one combatant's turn decrement the other's
stamina.**

What the bytes *do* permit is the villain spending its own turns.
`changeCombatants` swaps the roles every phase — `+0x2ba2` binds
`game_attacker` to `game.villain`, `+0x2c18` binds it back to `game.hero`, and
`+0x2bc5` then calls `villainChooseAction` — so while the hero walks five times
the villain takes phases of its own, and each of those runs the subtraction
above against the villain. That is the only mechanism the build offers, and the
capture wrapper's own side guard cites the same two offsets and the same fact
(*"on the arena route the villain fights back"*,
`ss2-capture-wrapper.as:1966`). It is **not** established that this is what
produced the −5: the villain's actions come from `villainChooseAction`, not
from `-Autopilot`, and neither the turn count nor the per-turn `staminacost`
was recorded. Worse for anyone hoping to pin it, that chooser **reads the
villain's own `staminaleft`** — it will not act below `10` and prefers `rest`
below 40% of `staminamax` (`+0x03e8`, `+0x0b33`) — so the quantity feeds back
into the decisions that move it. Do not treat the villain's 95 as derived from
anything.

Both numbers are transcriptions, and the repository says so. The committed
`test/fixtures/ss2-1v1-divergences/provisional-prisoner-kill--obs-20260830-t1-6bf4f120.json`
holds the map-derived prediction against what the runtime returned:
`/scenario/hero/staminaleft` **expected 110, actual 105**;
`/scenario/villain/staminaleft` **expected 100, actual 95**. The prediction was
a fresh bout at full stamina on both sides; the fixture was re-authored to the
runtime's two numbers, and the "five walks" explanation was written afterwards
to account for them. It accounts for the hero's, mechanically at least, and not
for the villain's at all.

The one operator-controlled lever **in this loop** is the saved gladiator in the
slot the navigator loads: `run-capture.ps1 -Navigate prisoner` has `-Autopilot`
and `-WatchFields` but no `-Stage*` at all. Equipment, enchantments, weapon
mode, and stats are staged by outfitting that gladiator through normal play
before the session.

**That is no longer the only lever in the project.** `-StageHero` /
`-StageVillain` write `field:value` pairs directly onto `_level1.game.hero` and
`_level1.game.villain` once `battle_started` is true, and they are exposed by
`run-arena.ps1` and `launch-capture.ps1` — not by `run-capture.ps1`. So a
"needs different equipment" row below is a shopping trip **only for the inputs
staging cannot fake**, which after the `battlevalues` audit is a short list:
`weapon` and `secondary_weapon` ids can be staged (they are inputs), the damage
spreads they imply cannot. Which script carries which flag is the runbook's §1,
and it is the one operational fact that decides how each fixture is run.

Every cell below was read out of the script's own `param()` block for this
revision, not carried over. An invented flag costs a supervised session, so
re-read the block rather than this table if the two ever disagree.

| Script | `-Stage*` | `-StageGold`/`-Shop*` | `-WatchFields` | `-Autopilot` | snapshots the save |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `run-arena.ps1` | yes | yes | **yes — new** | **no** | **yes, itself** |
| `run-capture.ps1` | **no** | **no** | yes | yes | no |
| `run-campaign.ps1` | **no** | **no** | **no** | yes | no |
| `launch-capture.ps1` | yes | yes | yes | yes | **no** |

**Corrected — `run-arena.ps1` now carries `-WatchFields`.** This table used to
read **no** in that cell, and the sentence under it sent every
`<piece>_defence` fixture to `launch-capture.ps1`. The flag exists
(`[string] $WatchFields = ''` in the `param()` block, forwarded verbatim only
when non-empty so an empty value leaves the launcher's default alone), and its
own comment says why it lives there rather than on `launch-capture.ps1`: the
snapshot guard is deliberately kept on the one save-mutating script, and moving
it down to the shared bottom layer would have made it opt-out. So a fixture
that stages a `<piece>_defence` name **and** needs a staged opponent now has a
save-guarded vehicle, and Group H's two `removal-destroys-*` members no longer
need the hand-snapshot detour.

`run-arena.ps1` also exposes `-StageGold`, `-ShopWeapon` and `-ShopArmour`,
which the earlier table omitted entirely. That matters more than it looks:
`weapon` staged at battle time is restored from `charDNA` at the next turn
boundary, so the shop path is the only durable way to change the weapon id —
see *The weapon spread is a table lookup* below.

What `run-arena.ps1` still does **not** have is `-Autopilot`. Its in-battle
decisions come from `-ArenaPolicy`, and `arenaPolicyStep` returns the literal
`"normal_attack"` whenever the controller offers it, so the arena route can
only ever produce hero directions **5–8**. Passing `-ArenaPolicy ''` to it does
not open that up: the wrapper re-arms the default when the policy is empty
*and* the autopilot step list is empty, which on this script it always is. Any
non-`normal_attack` direction on the arena route therefore needs
`launch-capture.ps1`, which is the only script exposing `-Autopilot` alongside
the arena flags — and which has no snapshot guard, so take the snapshot by hand
with `save-state.ps1 snapshot <new-name>` first.

### The twenty-three goldens, and what the probe pairs measured

`test/fixtures/ss2-1v1-golden/` now holds ~~**twenty-two**~~ **twenty-three**
promoted goldens, of two different kinds. The earlier revision of this document
was written when there were four, the revision after that when there were
eighteen, and the one after that when there were twenty-two.

► **CORRECTED 2026-09-07. Do not read the number, run the count:**
`ls test/fixtures/ss2-1v1-golden/*.json | wc -l`. This heading has been restated
at four different values and will be restated again. The 23rd is
`golden-armoured-deflection-threshold-cleared`, promoted 2026-09-02 (commit
`2341789`) from `obs-onx1405-a1` / `obs-onx1521-a1`, and it is the **first
golden outside the prisoner-and-probe band** — which is why "22" is still the
right number in some sentences on this page and the wrong one in others. Check
which set a sentence is counting before changing its number.

- **Twelve kills.** `golden-prisoner-normal-kill*` (directions 5–8),
  `golden-prisoner-power-kill*` (9–12) and `golden-prisoner-quick-kill*` (1–4)
  — **all three bands are now complete**, twelve directions of twelve. The
  quick band's four kill goldens are the ones this document last recorded as
  *inferred*.
- **Ten probes.** `golden-probe-*`, in five pairs, and a different kind of
  evidence. A probe pair stages this exact fight twice, changes **one**
  injected value between the arms, and is predicted to differ in a channel the
  capture genuinely observes. Repeating a capture adds sessions; a probe adds
  information.

| Pair (`golden-probe-…`) | The one value that moves | The observed channel that separates the arms | What it measured |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quick-rollneeded-{miss,hit}` | hit roll 26 → 27 | `defender-blocked` → `defender-hurt`, plus mutation trace, final state and draw count | quick-band `rollneeded` at this staging is exactly **27** |
| `normal-rollneeded-{miss,hit}` | hit roll 43 → 44 | as above | normal-band `rollneeded` is exactly **44** |
| `power-rollneeded-{miss,hit}` | hit roll 62 → 63 | as above | power-band `rollneeded` is exactly **63** |
| `deflection-threshold-{critical,cleared}` | deflection roll 99 → 100 | the dispatched `defender_hurt` method **alone** — `critical` → `normal` | the critical-deflection threshold is inclusive at exactly **100** against a defender with no helmet and no greaves |
| `armour-removal-gate-{below,above}` | removal roll 66 → 67 | the **draw count** alone — one extra `randomBetween(1, 2)` | the removal gate is `> 66`, and `remove_armour` draws its group selection *before* testing whether the piece is equipped |

Three consequences worth carrying forward.

- The three `rollneeded` brackets together settle the dispatcher's hit
  comparison as `diceroll >= rollneeded`, not `>`. Each pair brackets one
  band's smallest hitting roll between adjacent integers, and the three results
  (27, 44, 63) are exactly `100 - chance` for the mapped chances 73 / 56 / 37
  at this staging's ratio. A strict reading would need chances 74 / 57 / 38, and
  no factor in the map's `attack_chances` table yields any of them at that
  ratio (map §Chance calculation, §Attack roll dispatcher).
- The last two pairs are the sharpest evidence the set has, because each moves
  exactly one channel and nothing else: the deflection pair leaves mutations,
  final state and draw count identical; the removal pair leaves events,
  mutations and final state identical. Neither can be satisfied by a fixture
  agreeing with itself.
- The deflection pair pins the *comparison*, not the *formula*. Both arms are
  staged against the unarmoured prisoner, so the threshold under test is
  `100 - 0 + 0`. The helmet/greaves operand mix is still unobserved.
  `candidate-deflection-threshold-discriminator` was the fixture that would
  settle it, and it has since been **superseded by a strictly stronger
  instrument**: `candidate-champion-deflection-threshold-discriminator`. The
  champion's `helmet` field is 102 while his `helmet_defence` is 25, so the two
  rival readings are −51 and 64.5 rather than 83 and 87 — far enough apart that
  one bans criticals against him entirely and the other allows them, which
  separates the readings in *two* observed channels (the dispatched
  `defender_hurt` method and the mutation trace) instead of one injected roll
  sitting between two close numbers.

The experimental-design contract these pairs have to keep is asserted in
`test/ss2-probe-fixtures.test.js`, which fails if a later edit quietly turns a
probe back into a pair whose arms differ only in echoed values.

#### Corrected — four of the twelve kill goldens rest on one independent observation, not two

The promotion gate requires two matching observations, and all twenty-two clear
it on paper. But for four of them the **first** cited observation is the record
the candidate was authored from, so that match was guaranteed before any capture
ran. Candidate and observation land in the *same commit*, at the same file size:

**This table is the state BEFORE the re-promotion, kept because it is the
record of the defect.** All four have since been re-promoted from every other
committed record that matches them, and none now cites the record in its
"Copied from" column — see `docs/integration/ss2-golden-harness.md` for what
each cites today. The candidates are unchanged and still declare
`provenance.authoredFrom`; what moved is which observations the GOLDENS rest on.

| Golden | Cited observations (retired) | Copied from | Landed together | Second observation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `golden-prisoner-normal-kill` | `obs-20260830-t1`, `obs-camp3` | `obs-20260830-t1` | `135f2115`, 15:45 | 17:56 |
| `golden-prisoner-normal-kill-dir8` | `obs-20260830-u1`, `obs-camp4` | `obs-20260830-u1` | `5f45627`, 16:00 | 17:56 |
| `golden-prisoner-normal-kill-dir6` | `obs-diag`, `obs-gold3` | `obs-diag` (`obs-20260830-auto1.json`) | `19aead3`, 16:19 | 17:32 |
| `golden-prisoner-normal-kill-dir5` | `obs-nav6`, `obs-camp1` | `obs-nav6` (`obs-20260830-auto2.json`) | `5317cec`, 17:18 | 17:56 |

`135f2115` states the method and draws the opposite conclusion in the same
breath: *"candidate-prisoner-normal-kill is authored directly FROM that
observation record (scenario and tape copied verbatim from the live state dump
…), so it carries no transcription. … obs-20260830-t1.json is observation 1 of
the 2 the promotion gate requires."* A copy cannot fail to match its source. So
what these four carry is **one** independent observation each — the second,
which is genuine evidence.

Three things this does **not** say, because the distinction is the whole point:

- **The measurements are not in question.** The game really did produce those
  outcomes, and the second observation of each pair says so independently. What
  is wrong is the *count* of independent evidence, not the numbers.
- **The other eighteen are unaffected in this respect.** The power, quick and
  probe candidates were authored as predictions *before* any matching
  observation existed (`d1da29e` 18:14 and `de3b2e1` 18:49, against probe
  observations at 19:19; `d1da29e`'s own message: *"nothing here is runtime
  evidence"*), and both of each one's cited observations came afterwards. Their
  `scenario` block is inherited from `candidate-prisoner-normal-kill-dir5` —
  identical for all ten probes, and differing only in `attackDirection` for the
  power and quick kills — and so descends from a transcription, which is correct
  practice, since a fixture has to describe a state a capture can actually
  reach. Their tape and expected outcome do not.
- **`provenance.kind` cannot tell you which is which.**
  `src/golden/run-1v1-fixture.js` rejects any candidate that does not declare
  `synthetic-static-map` with `runtimeVerified: false`, so a transcribed
  candidate and a derived one carry identical provenance **by construction**.
  That field records the rule the corpus is held to, not the history of any
  particular file. To establish how a number got into a fixture, read the
  authoring commit and the divergence report beside it — not the provenance
  block.

## What a session costs

**The prisoner route writes the save on every run.** An earlier version of this
section claimed the route was save-neutral because town square is the only
flush site and the route never enters it. That reasoning is wrong, and it was
wrong in a way that mattered: `refresh_gladiators` ends unconditionally with
`SharedObject.getLocal("ss2_data")` and a `flush()`, and it is called from root
frame 35 (`new_or_continue`) and root frame 84 (`load_saved_gladiators`) —
both of which the navigator passes through, at `navStep 0` and `navStep 1`.
Every capture session to date has flushed the store twice before reaching a
fight.

What is true, and what the evidence base actually rests on, is narrower and
was verified rather than reasoned: the write is a near-identity rewrite, so the
*content* does not change. `ss2_data.sol` has been byte-identical — 679 bytes,
SHA-256 `6A06E9E8...` — before and after every capture, checked against a
snapshot, while its modification time moves. So the data is safe, but that
safety is a property of what `refresh_gladiators` happens to write, not of the
route avoiding it.

The distinction is load-bearing because the same function carries a **reset
branch**: if `so_local.max_gladiators` reads as `undefined`, `0` or `NaN`, it
blanks `character1`…`character11` to `"Empty,0"`, sets the count to zero, and
flushes. That is almost certainly the "last writer wins" clobbering the
launcher already warns about. Snapshot `ss2_data.sol` around **every** session,
not only levelled ones.

**A levelled session is not save-neutral.** Root frame 150 calls
`save_character(_global.current_character)` on *every* entry to the town
square; `save_character` re-derives the hero, writes it into
`so_local["character" + n]`, then calls `SharedObject.getLocal("ss2_data")`
and flushes it. There is no path from `daybreak` to the arena foyer that avoids the
town square, and the reward button returns through it after each win — so gold,
experience, level, equipment and the battle counters are persisted at least
twice per fight loop (arena route §8).

Three things follow for anything staged on the levelled route, which from here
on is most of this page:

- The capture protocol's install-hash attestation covers the SWF, not the
  SharedObject, so a mutated save will never surface as a verification
  failure. It has to be handled by procedure, not by the pipeline.
- Use a **dedicated capture slot**, and copy `ss2_data.sol` before the session
  and restore it after. Without that, session 2 of a family is staged
  differently from session 1 — which is exactly the class of divergence this
  pipeline already had to chase once, over the approach's stamina drift.

  **This is now largely mechanised, and the mechanism is worth knowing exactly**,
  because its guarantees are narrower than "the save is protected".

  - `run-arena.ps1` takes the snapshot **itself**, before anything is launched:
    `-Snapshot <name>` is `Mandatory`, `save-state.ps1` refuses a name that
    already exists, and a non-zero exit throws
    `Snapshotting failed; refusing to run a save-mutating session.` It is the
    only launcher that calls `save-state.ps1` at all — `run-capture.ps1`,
    `run-campaign.ps1` and `launch-capture.ps1` do not, by design, because the
    guard is deliberately kept on the one save-mutating script rather than made
    opt-out on the shared bottom layer.
  - `save-state.ps1` now **refuses a damaged save in both directions**, which
    the earlier text did not record. `snapshot` runs `Test-SaveIntact` on the
    live root *before* mirroring and again on the mirrored copy afterwards, so a
    snapshot cannot be reported as taken unless the thing worth restoring is in
    it. `restore` runs `Test-SaveIntact` on the source, and `Test-WipedSave` on
    it as well, both before `Invoke-Mirror` — which matters because that mirror
    is `robocopy /MIR` and deletes at the destination, so a post-hoc check would
    arrive after the gladiator was gone. Both `restore` guards are bypassable
    with `-Force`; the empty-tree guard and the Ruffle-running check are not.
  - **What `Test-SaveIntact` actually proves is the first 78 bytes plus one
    arithmetic identity**, and no more: the `00 BF` prefix, the four ASCII
    markers `TCSO` / `ss2_data` / `max_gladiators` / `character1` (the last of
    which ends at byte 78), a 128-byte floor, and `declared == length − 6` read
    big-endian from bytes 2–5. The gladiator's DNA string begins after that, so
    a save whose body is destroyed while its header stays self-consistent —
    a tail overwrite, or a truncation whose length field was rewritten to
    match — passes in both directions. Do not read a clean `snapshot` as a
    statement that the gladiator survived; read it as "the header is not
    obviously wrong".
  - Two smaller edges, both worth recognising rather than working around.
    `snapshot` applies `Test-SaveIntact` but **not** `Test-WipedSave`, so an
    already-blanked save can still be snapshotted under a reassuring name (it
    will be refused on the way back out). And the intactness check runs *before*
    the `Get-Process ruffle` check, so a healthy save that is merely open reads
    as an I/O error, and one caught mid-flush reads as `TRUNCATED` — a false
    diagnosis whose obvious next step, a restore, would overwrite a healthy
    save. If `run-arena.ps1` refuses to start with a truncation message, close
    every Ruffle window and re-run the snapshot before believing it.
- **Corrected — a tournament loss does NOT end the character.** This bullet
  used to read "a tournament **loss ends the character**", and treated it as
  the reason a backup mattered. The byte fact it rested on is real and
  unchanged: `sprite:2249/frame:315` `+0x03a2` branches on
  `tournament_in_progress` into the game-over path instead of the ordinary loss
  panel. What does not follow is the consequence. Losing the *screen* is not
  losing the *slot*: `save_character` has exactly three call sites (root frame
  150 `+0x0585`, button 1565 `+0x02d6`, button 2042 `+0x020f`) and **none is
  reachable from a bout, the ladder, the win chain or the loss path** (arena
  route §3). Observed: ~~22~~ **23** `ABORT:battle-lost` lines across
  `captures/arena-*`, ~~twelve~~ **thirteen** of them to the rank-1 champion,
  and the gladiator survived every one —
  it lost gold and battle counters that had never been flushed.

  The backup still matters, for the reason in the two bullets above rather than
  this one; and `run-arena.ps1 -Attempts N` deliberately does *not* restore on
  retry, because the save already holds every completed bout.

**Sessions can run in parallel, and the save is what decides which ones.**
`run-campaign.ps1 -Concurrency N` gives each session its own SharedObject store
seeded byte-identically from the real save; three rounds in 35 s with three
matches and zero divergences is the measured figure. The scope limit follows
from this page's own subject: per-session stores **fork** the save, which is
right for a prisoner campaign, where every session stages the same gladiator
from the same starting point, and wrong for the arena route, which must
**accumulate** across bouts. `-Concurrency > 1` is refused for any navigator
but `prisoner`. Group A is therefore the only group this parallelism helps, and
it is already fully promoted.

## Villain-side staging

The operator cannot freely set opponent stats, and the three fights now mapped
differ enormously in how much control there is — enough that the difference
decides which fights are worth capturing at all. An earlier revision of this
section said the duel opponent was "drawn by the game". That understates it
badly, and the correction is the most consequential one on this page.

- **Tutorial prisoner fight**: the villain is fixed (the all-zero prisoner).
  There is no villain-side staging; a fixture must be authored to it. Every
  golden in the set comes from this one fight.
- **Ordinary arena duel**: the opponent is **procedurally generated, not drawn
  from a roster**, and it is regenerated on every entry.
  `randomise_gladiator(villain, avatar, hero.herolevel)` builds a fresh
  gladiator at the hero's own level: appearance from four `RandomNumber` opcode
  draws; `statpoints = ceil(herolevel * 5) - 8` spread by a distribution loop
  driven by two more opcode draws; weapons, ammunition and enchantments from a
  long run mixing `randomBetween` calls **and** further opcode draws; armour
  per piece, plus a matched-suit path that sets all eight pieces at once when
  its own opcode draw clears (arena route §2). The gate that might have
  suppressed regeneration reads `_global.fightstarted`, which is assigned
  nowhere in the build, so it reduces to `fight_mode == "duel"` and always
  fires. Two live duel captures drew two different opponents — one wearing
  helmet 2 + shield 2 (`armourclass_max 44`), one with no armour at all — which
  is why `candidate-duel-absorbed-normal-hit` has a divergence report against
  the session that produced `candidate-duel-firstblood-normal-kill`. That was
  not bad luck; it is what the generator does every time.
- **Tournament bout**: the whole field is **pre-generated once**, when the
  foyer's `tournament` span first runs, behind a `tournament_in_progress`
  guard, and is not redrawn between bouts. The hero enters at
  `tournament_ranking = tournament_max_gladiators` and loses one rank per win;
  `_root.game.villain` is bound from the ranking before the fight, and root
  frame 214's `randomise_gladiator` call sits behind the duel gate, so it
  leaves the binding alone. Rank 1 is the tournament boss (arena route §3).

> **Duels are not a viable capture target, and tournaments are.** The AVM1

### Correction — the block above is sound about the generator and wrong about the conclusion

Every sentence in it about `randomise_gladiator` still holds; two live
qualifications have since been added to the *tournament* half, and the *duel*
half's conclusion has been overturned outright. Keeping the paragraph is the
point: it is the record of why the project wrote off two committed fixtures.

**What overturned it is a capability that did not exist when it was written.**
The block reasons about what a capture can *observe* and *reconstruct*. But
promotion does not compare a capture against the generator's output; it
compares a capture against the fixture, and it compares **only the keys the
fixture names**:

```js
// src/golden/capture-ingest.js
villain: projectFields(staged.villain.fields, Object.keys(fixture.scenario.villain), …)
```

`-StageVillain` writes any `field:number` pair onto that same
`_level1.game.villain` object, for 20 frames after `battle_started`, before the
action arms (`applyStageSide`, `stepStaging`). So every key the projection will
look at is overwritten after the generator has finished and before anything
reads it. **The un-interceptable draw stops mattering, because nothing that is
compared survives it.** That closes the gap the block called permanent, and it
closes it for duels as well as tournaments.

Four qualifications the block did not have:

- **Every projected field must be staged, including zeroes.** A generated
  opponent that turns up wearing a breastplate fails the final-state comparison
  unless the fixture's zeroes are staged too.
- **The tournament field is only partly inspectable.**
  `_root.game.villain1` is an empty `Object` — foyer frame 22 creates it and
  then builds the champion into `_root.game.champion` instead — and derived
  fields (`hitpointsmax`, `armourclass`, `min_damage`, `max_damage`) read
  `undefined` until that villain has been through `skincharacter` as the active
  villain. What is readable up front is `attack`, `defence` and the per-piece
  tiers (arena route §3).
- **Staging a ladder object persists for the rest of that tournament**, because
  `game.villain` is an alias of `game["villain" + (ranking − 1)]`. Restore the
  snapshot between attempts; never chain two captures in one ladder.
- **The one opponent that needs no staging at all** is tournament rank 1.
  `unleash_hell` builds it from a hard-coded `charDNA` literal and contains
  zero RNG of any kind; "John the Butcher", `hitpointsmax` 110,
  `armourclass` 86, identical across ~~twelve~~ **fifteen** independent launches
  archive-wide (fourteen of them in `captures/arena-*`, the fifteenth in
  `session-champ-n1`). *(Re-derived 2026-09-07; every one of the fifteen carries
  the identical 110/86 triple, so the claim is strengthened.)* Its every
  combat field is decoded in [the champion DNA map](ss2-champion-dna.md).

Three routes now exist, and the distinction above decides which applies:

1. **Stage it.** Overwrite the villain's projected fields with `-StageVillain`
   and let the generator draw whatever it likes. This is the route for the
   `armoured`, `tournament` and duel families, and it is the reason the "cannot
   be drawn twice" objection no longer decides anything.
2. **Inspect, then commit** — tournaments only, and now largely superseded by
   route 1. Read the pre-generated field at the foyer and enter only if a
   ranked opponent matches. Useful when a fixture's villain block is *not*
   fully projected, or as a sanity check before spending a ladder.
3. **Capture first, author second.** Capture against whatever opponent turned
   up and author a **new** candidate from the observed staged state: ingest
   records the observed values, the mismatch with the intended fixture surfaces
   as an explicit scenario divergence, and a candidate with the observed
   scenario can be generated through the resolver and verified on the next
   session. The pipeline is built for this direction too — evidence first,
   fixture second. Both duel candidates and the whole prisoner family were
   authored this way. This is no longer the *only* route for a duel.

## Reachability groups

`test/ss2-fixture-files.js` is the authority on what is committed. It
**discovers** `test/fixtures/ss2-1v1/` from disk and classifies each fixture by
its declared action identity — `scenario.attackDirection` into
`SS2_FIXTURE_FILES` (physical, replayed through
`resolveSs2PhysicalAttackCandidate`), `scenario.spellId` into
`SS2_SPELL_FIXTURE_FILES` (spell, `resolveSs2SpellDamageCandidate`) — and
asserts the two are disjoint, together cover the directory, and that every
discovered fixture is actually replayed. It is no longer a hand-kept roster, so
a new fixture cannot be missing from it. The set
grows steadily, so treat those two lists as the count and the table below as a
partition of them, not of a number. At the time of writing that is **52
physical and 8 spell** candidates — up from 39 physical at the last revision,
the thirteen new ones being the five `candidate-armoured-*`, the three
`candidate-tournament-*` and the five `candidate-champion-*`. ~~Twenty-two~~
**Twenty-three** are promoted, so **~~38~~ 37 are uncaptured**. *(Re-derived
2026-09-07 by name-matching `test/fixtures/ss2-1v1/` against
`test/fixtures/ss2-1v1-golden/`; the group table below sums to 37 with Group H
at 4.)*

**This table's verdicts were the most out-of-date thing on the page.** Its
premise was that most of the set was unreachable; that is now largely false.
[The staging runbook](ss2-staging-runbook.md) carries the per-fixture detail
and one runnable command line each — read it for *how*, and this table for
*what stands in the way*. Do not duplicate its commands here.

| Group | Fixtures | Uncaptured | Binding constraint, as it stands |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| A | prisoner kills + probes | 0 | **none** — all 22 promoted, all three bands complete. *(This 22 is CORRECT and is not the repo total: group A is 12 `golden-prisoner-*` plus 10 `golden-probe-*`. The 23rd golden is Group H's.)* |
| **H** | `candidate-armoured-*` | ~~5~~ **4** | **no staging blocker** — reachable with `-StageVillain`, runbook §3. ~~42 live rounds have produced 0 matches.~~ **One of the five matched twice and was promoted 2026-09-02 as `golden-armoured-deflection-threshold-cleared`** (commit `2341789`), so the family is no longer at zero. The wrong-side gate is repaired and direction 5 lands; `staminaleft` is the one field still standing. See below *(the count 5→4 is corrected; a proposed correction saying `staminaleft` had been closed by staging it was REFUTED on 2026-09-07 as a measurement error and is deliberately not applied)* |
| **I** | `candidate-tournament-*` | 3 | **none. Reachable now**; runbook §4. `tournament-nonlethal-normal-hit` is the cheapest capture in the set |
| **J** | `candidate-champion-*` | 5 | conditional, and **possibly the same 2/10-hero problem in another costume** — the opponent is reproducible, but four of the five hero values the fixtures assert have no writer in the tooling. Open; see below |
| B | duel | 2 | **no longer the opponent.** A second, *lower*-level gladiator (`herolevel < tournament_level_required`), plus two weapon ids that this revision names |
| C | legacy armour | 6 | **the hero build does not exist** — implied weapon 2/10 |
| D | ranged and bash | 3 | same 2/10 hero; plus a secondary weapon and an unproven `swap_weapons` autopilot |
| E | tournament-only, no equipment | 5 | same 2/10 hero; plus a boolean-status blocker on `lethal-result` and an open question on `taunt` |
| F | grievous | 1 | same 2/10 hero; plus the `psyche_up` chain and its `herolevel` question |
| G | spell | 8 | **the wrapper** — no `magic-damage` event and no arming site on the ingress |

(The runbook letters its families differently; when cross-reading, match on the
fixture prefix rather than the letter.)

**Scoreboard.** ~~8~~ **7** uncaptured candidates have no *staging* blocker
(H's 4 and I's 3; H dropped by one on the 2026-09-02 promotion).
5 more are conditional on the champion gate (J). 2 are reachable in principle
but need a second gladiator (B). 8 are blocked in the wrapper (G). **15 cannot
be captured as written at all** (C, D, E, F), and the blocker is not staging —
it is that their hero's `strength` / `min_damage` / `max_damage` triple
corresponds to no weapon row in the build. That is a fixture edit, and it is
not this document's to make.

**Read the H and I line carefully, because it has been over-read once.** "No
staging blocker" is not "a session will produce a golden". **Forty-two** live
arena rounds against one Group H fixture on 2026-08-31 — `session-adc1`–`adc22`
before the wrong-side guard was repaired and `adc30`–`adc49` after — produced
**zero** matches and **eleven** committed divergence reports, and not one of the
eleven failed on staging. In the first batch of six, five failed on the observed
`attack_direction` and one (`adc18`) matched the direction and failed on
`/mutationTrace/0/path` because the villain had swung. In the second batch of
five, **nothing failed except `staminaleft`** (`adc47` also carries a hero
`hitpoints` dent from the villain swing the repaired guard refused). All eleven
carry a `staminaleft` difference. Those are sampling, attribution and
unspecified-state costs, not staging costs, and the distinction is the one this
table exists to make — but a reader planning a supervised window needs all the
numbers. The per-fixture arithmetic is under Group H.

~~The runbook's own scoreboard says "9 more behind one read-only weapon-table
sweep".~~ ► **CORRECTED 2026-09-07: the runbook says no such thing any more.**
`grep -c 'weapon-table sweep' docs/integration/ss2-staging-runbook.md` returns
**0**; its §11 row for family C now reads *"Not on a weapon sweep; there is
nothing to sweep for"* — i.e. it has already absorbed this page's answer. **That
sweep has been done** — [the item tables](ss2-item-tables.md)
decodes all 90 weapon rows — and its answer for those fixtures is negative,
now as a proof rather than as a search. See *The weapon spread is a table
lookup* above.

No committed fixture *resolves* on a path that is entirely opcode-rolled. The
only `RandomNumber` opcode samples inside a fixture's own roll stream are the
cosmetic `armour-debris-*` rolls of `candidate-armour-removal-debris`, and
those are excluded from observation matching on both sides, so they block
nothing. The genuinely unreachable-by-design paths named in the runtime-capture
workflow — range taunts and other opcode-rolled decisions that make no
`randomBetween` call — have no fixture, by design. This says nothing about how
a combatant was *built*: the duel opponent is opcode-generated before the roll
stream begins (see Villain-side staging) — which used to be a staging blocker
even though it never appears in a tape, and is one no longer, because staging
overwrites the generator's output before anything compares it.

### Group A — reachable with the staged tutorial fight

Same navigation, same saved gladiator, same prisoner. Only the autopilot's
final label changes, because `power_attack`, `normal_attack`, and
`quick_attack` all live on controller frame 13 (`closerange_warrior`).

| Fixture | Direction/action | Staging notes | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate-prisoner-normal-kill` | 7 (`normal_attack`) | the staged fight exactly as above | **verified** — promoted to `golden-prisoner-normal-kill` |
| `candidate-prisoner-normal-kill-dir5` | 5 | as above | **verified** — promoted |
| `candidate-prisoner-normal-kill-dir6` | 6 | as above | **verified** — promoted |
| `candidate-prisoner-normal-kill-dir8` | 8 | as above | **verified** — promoted |
| `candidate-prisoner-power-kill-dir9` | 9 (`power_attack`) | autopilot `walkright*5,power_attack`; no new staging | **verified** — promoted to `golden-prisoner-power-kill-dir9` |
| `candidate-prisoner-power-kill-dir10` | 10 | as above | **verified** — promoted |
| `candidate-prisoner-power-kill-dir11` | 11 | as above | **verified** — promoted |
| `candidate-prisoner-power-kill-dir12` | 12 | as above | **verified** — promoted |
| `candidate-prisoner-quick-kill-dir1` | 1 (`quick_attack`) | autopilot `walkright*5,quick_attack`; no new staging | **verified** — promoted to `golden-prisoner-quick-kill-dir1` |

| `candidate-prisoner-quick-kill-dir3` | 3 | as above | **verified** — promoted |
| `candidate-prisoner-quick-kill-dir4` | 4 | as above | **verified** — promoted |

The last four rows read **inferred** at the last revision, with the note that
"only the kill tape is unobserved". They have since been captured; all twelve
melee directions now carry a kill golden.

**Read "verified" narrowly on the first four rows.** The four `normal-kill`
candidates were each authored from the first observation cited for them, so one
of their two promotion observations is a copy of the fixture rather than a test
of it — see
[four of the twelve kill goldens](#corrected--four-of-the-twelve-kill-goldens-rest-on-one-independent-observation-not-two).
The outcomes are real; the independent-evidence count is one, not two. The eight
`power-` and `quick-` rows do not have this problem: those candidates predate
every observation cited for them.

The three bands are separate campaign families: their injectable tapes differ
(normal draws `randomBetween(min,max)` then a 1–20 critical; power takes
`max_damage` with a 5–20 critical; quick takes `min_damage` with a −20..20
critical and no knockback roll), and injection is tape-positional, so one
`run-campaign.ps1` run covers one band.

The ten probe candidates stage this same fight and reuse
`candidate-prisoner-normal-kill-dir5`'s scenario verbatim — same gladiator,
same prisoner, same `misc` mode, same attacker side. Only the tape differs, so
each pair is one more family for the campaign loop and needs no new staging at
all. All ten are promoted; the evidence they carry is set out under
[The twenty-two goldens](#the-twenty-two-goldens-and-what-the-probe-pairs-measured).

| Fixture pair | Direction | Staging notes | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate-probe-quick-rollneeded-{miss,hit}` | 1 (`quick_attack`) | as the staged fight; arms differ only in the injected hit roll (26 / 27) | **verified** — both promoted |
| `candidate-probe-normal-rollneeded-{miss,hit}` | 5 (`normal_attack`) | as above (43 / 44) | **verified** — both promoted |
| `candidate-probe-power-rollneeded-{miss,hit}` | 9 (`power_attack`) | as above (62 / 63) | **verified** — both promoted |
| `candidate-probe-deflection-threshold-{critical,cleared}` | 5 | as above; injected critical 20 and deflection roll 99 / 100 | **verified** — both promoted |
| `candidate-probe-armour-removal-gate-{below,above}` | 5 | as above; injected removal roll 66 / 67 | **verified** — both promoted |

The miss arms are the cheapest rows in the whole set: a miss calls no
`damagecharacter`, so its tape is two or three samples long and its expected
mutation trace is empty.

### Group H — `candidate-armoured-*` (5). Reachable now.

Tournament bout on the levelled route, staged opponent, direction 5,
`normal_attack`. All five stage the *same* hero, and the hero side wants to be
**real, not staged**: the block decodes to a specific gladiator rather than an
arbitrary one.

| Fixture value (hero) | Required input |
| --- | --- |
| `min_damage 21` / `max_damage 23` at `strength 10` | `weapon0`, the starting weapon — **do not shop** |
| `hitpointsmax 300` | `herolevel 4` with **`vitality 13`** |
| `staminamax 110` | `stamina 1` — the tutorial value |
| `staminaleft 105` | **nothing derives this** — it is transcribed from the prisoner capture (below). Stage it, or expect it to diverge |
| `armourclass_max 0` | all eight pieces 0 — **do not buy armour** |
| `attack`/`defence`/`charisma`/`magicka 1`, `strength 10` | untouched tutorial values, i.e. a **vitality-only** levelling |

That is snapshot `level4-vitality-tournament-gate`, and it is what the fixtures
were authored to. Root frame 214 full-heals the hero at battle construction
(`hero.hitpoints = hero.hitpointsmax` at `+0x02a9`), so
`hitpoints == hitpointsmax` before staging runs and the `check_stats` clamp
problem never arises on the hero side.

> **Check this before the first run, and do not stage around it.** The
> `level4-vitality-tournament-gate` level-up log reads `hitpointsmax` **220**,
> which `herolevel 4 + vitality 13` cannot produce. The explanation on record is
> that 220 is the *pre-spend* value — `battlevalues` had last run before the
> four points went in — and that the next `battlevalues` produces 300. That is
> consistent and it has never been read back live. One passive run reports the
> hero's fields. If it really reads 220, the gladiator is at `vitality 9` and
> needs the remaining points spent through the game's own level-up screen;
> staging `vitality:13` instead works, but adds the clamp race below to a
> fixture family that does not otherwise have one.

The villain side is where staging does the work. `randomise_gladiator` builds
each ladder rank at the hero's own level, and `-StageVillain` then overwrites
every projected key:

| Fixture value (villain) | Required input |
| --- | --- |
| `hitpointsmax 80` | `herolevel 4` + `vitality 2` |
| `armourclass_max 79` | helmet 6 (60) + shoulderguard 1 (8) + greaves 2 (6) + gauntlet 1 (5), **and `armourclass`/`armourclass_max` staged directly** |
| `armourclass_max 22` | helmet 2 (20) + boot 1 (2), same |
| `defence 3` | staged raw |

The chance the fixtures encode falls straight out:
`round(((1 + 9) / (3 + 9)) * 100 * 0.50) = 42`, `rollNeeded 58` — which is why
`hero.attack 1` and `villain.defence 3` are both load-bearing and neither may
drift.

**Staging notes that are not obvious:**

- Stage the raw piece **and** its `<piece>_defence`. The defence values are
  recomputed unconditionally as `round(piece × dval)`, so the write is a no-op
  — but ingest refuses a trace whose staged dump lacks a field the fixture
  stages, and the wrapper must dump it.
- `-WatchFields` is additive onto a 28-name default that omits the defence
  names (counted from `DEFAULT_WATCH_FIELDS` for this revision: 18 projected
  fields plus 10 staged-scenario inputs). Only the two `removal-destroys-*`
  fixtures in this family need it (`helmet_defence,shoulderguard_defence`).
  **Corrected: all five now run on `run-arena.ps1`.** This bullet used to end
  "three of the five run on `run-arena.ps1` unmodified and two must go through
  `launch-capture.ps1`"; `run-arena.ps1` has since gained `-WatchFields`, so the
  two `removal-destroys-*` members no longer have to leave the save-guarded
  vehicle. Nothing else about them changes.
- **Direction attrition is the dominant cost, not the staging.**
  `normal_attack` draws `randomBetween(5, 8)` *before* the tape is served, so a
  direction-5 fixture matches roughly one bout in four. **Both halves of that
  sentence are confirmed for this revision, and the second half is the one
  worth reading twice**, because a tape that *could* dictate the direction
  would make every injected-tape observation of it worthless.

  - The **range** is byte-verified: `normal_attack` calls
    `randomBetween` with `numArgs 2, arg1 5, arg2 8` at overlay `+0x61f1`, and
    `randomBetween` is `a + Math.floor(Math.random() * (b - a + 1))`, inclusive
    at both ends. `P(5) = 0.25` exactly. The neighbouring bands are power
    `(9, 12)` at `+0x608a` and quick `(1, 4)` at `+0x635c`; direction 20 is not
    a band at all but the taunt constant at `+0x6981`.
  - **"Before the tape is served" is a property of the arming latch, not a
    guess.** `tappedRandom()` returns the real `Math.random` while `!armed` and
    only consults the tape afterwards; `armed` is set in exactly one place,
    `beginAction()`, reachable only from the `checkattackroll` wrap and the
    `attack_chances` wrap. In every dispatcher branch the direction assignment
    *precedes* that branch's `checkattackroll` call — normal `+0x61f1` →
    `+0x62ad`, power `+0x608a` → `+0x6146`, quick `+0x635c` → `+0x6418`, bash
    `+0x64c3` → `+0x64e2`, taunt `+0x6981` → `+0x698c` — and `attack_chances`
    is itself called from inside `checkattackroll` at `+0x2c44`. The wrapper
    never writes `attack_direction`; it only reads it. So the direction in a
    trace is an observation even on a fully injected session, it consumes no
    tape slot, and a direction-5 observation from an injected-tape run counts
    for exactly as much as one from a passive run.

  With the two-observation gate a 1-in-4 direction is about **eight** bouts per
  fixture *if the hero is the one swinging*. On the arena route he is not,
  about half the time — see the next bullet — so budget nearer **sixteen**.

- **Corrected twice — the wrapper's attacker-side gate was dead, and has since
  been repaired and measured working.** Read the rest of this bullet as history;
  the planning advice at the end of it is superseded. Current state, measured
  from the tree rather than from a commit message:

  - `captureAllowedNow` now reads `overlayClip().game_attacker` and **fails
    closed** — `isHero == isVillain` (both false, i.e. unresolved) is itself a
    refusal (`ss2-capture-wrapper.as:1966`).
  - Seven capture sessions log `capture-refused-wrong-side` once each —
    `session-adc{32,34,35,36,45,47,48}` — where the whole prior census of 268
    logs had zero.
  - ~~Nineteen~~ **1343** `.rufflelog` files carry `attacker-resolved-hero`
    archive-wide (17 if scoped to `session-adc30`–`adc49`, which is the window
    this bullet was written against — neither reading is nineteen) and **zero**
    carry `attacker-resolved-villain`. **The zero is the durable half and it
    still holds exactly, archive-wide.** Re-derive both with
    `grep -rl 'attacker-resolved-hero' /mnt/c/ss2-capture/captures | wc -l`.
    It is the line the repaired guard
    emits only after it has actually resolved the identity. A run whose log
    carries neither line has a dead guard again; that is what the line is for.
  - A refusal costs nothing: the wrapper re-arms on the hero's next attack in
    the same bout. `adc47`'s one non-stamina divergence — hero `hitpoints` 288
    rather than 300 — is the predicted price of waiting through a villain swing,
    not a new problem.

  Direction 5 consequently lands now: `adc33`, `adc35`, `adc37` and `adc42` are
  clean direction-5 hero swings, which is what makes `staminaleft` the sole
  remaining blocker in the next bullet.

  The history, because the failure mode is worth recognising again. This bullet
  once read "the wrapper has no attacker-side gate either". It had one:
  `captureAllowedNow` refuses when the observed attacker disagrees with the
  launcher's `attackerSide`. That refusal had **never fired anywhere**, and the
  reason was a scope mismatch rather than anything about this route:

  - the guard reads `gameRoot().game_attacker`, and `gameRoot()` returns
    `_level1`;
  - the game writes `game_attacker` with a bare `SetVariable` at
    `sprite:862[overlay]/frame:52/DoAction@0x240c7f` `+0x2ba2` (villain) and
    `+0x2c18` (hero) — an AVM1 scope-chain write that resolves on the **overlay
    clip**, which is where the wrapper correctly reads its sibling
    `attack_direction` from;
  - so `attacker` is `undefined`, and the guard's `if (attacker != undefined)`
    skips the comparison wholesale rather than refusing.

  Measured, not inferred — ~~**as of the 268-log census; the tree now holds 292
  logs and seven of them do carry the refusal, see the head of this bullet.**~~
  ► **CORRECTED 2026-09-07, and this is the third value this sentence has
  carried.** The archive at `/mnt/c/ss2-capture/captures` (which DOES resolve
  from a WSL session on this box) holds **1650** `.rufflelog` files, of which
  **631** carry `capture-refused-wrong-side`. Four further paths carry the
  string and are NOT traces — three cached wrapper sources and a
  `vehicle-check` decompile — so an unscoped `grep -rl` returns 635 and must be
  restricted with `find . -name '*.rufflelog'`. **Stop writing a number here.**
  Of those original 268 archived `.rufflelog` files, **zero** contained
  `capture-refused-wrong-side`, and so did zero `.jsonl` traces. A whole-tree
  grep of `captures/` then returned exactly six paths, and they were three archived
  wrapper *sources* plus the three `.swf` binaries compiled from them — not six
  log lines, and all three are arena-era builds. The twenty-two `session-adc*`
  arena rounds
  ran build `F636F80A433486D1`, which carries the guard at line 1978, and split
  by which combatant the first `damagecharacter` write actually landed on:

  | Who swung | n | `attack_direction` values |
  | --- | ---: | --- |
  | hero | 11 | 8, 8, 7, 8, 7, 6, 8, 8, 6, 7, 7 — **never 5** |
  | **villain** | **9** | 4, 10, 11, 20, 3, 2, **5**, 20, 10 |

  All twenty-two meta lines read `"attackerSide":"hero"`, and the guard logged
  nothing. Nine mislabelled traces with a live guard present is a direct proof
  that the read is undefined at arming time on this route; the byte fact above
  is why it was undefined on every other route too. **That instruction — "treat
  the guard as absent when planning" — no longer applies; the guard is repaired
  and fires.** (The live half of that proof is arena-only: the prisoner
  never **swings**, so a *working* guard — which only tests at arming, and the
  wrapper only arms on an attack — would also have logged zero there. It is the
  scope mismatch, not the log census, that generalises. This used to read "never
  gives the villain a turn"; that is stronger than the evidence and the bytes
  contradict it. `changeCombatants` alternates `game_attacker` every phase, and
  the prisoner's `staminaleft` moved 100 → 95 in the very capture the goldens
  come from — which, per §*The staged fight*, only its **own** phases can do.
  The prisoner takes turns; it just never attacks on them.)

  Two planning consequences **from the dead-guard era**, both now discharged by
  the repair. While the guard was dead a villain swing was not a wasted round
  but a **poisoned** one — it produced a complete trace labelled `hero`, caught
  only because `/mutationTrace/0/path` diverged, which held only while every
  reachable fixture expected a villain-side mutation. `session-adc18` is a
  villain swing at direction **5**, so *direction alone must never be used to
  attribute a swing* — that lesson stands whatever the guard is doing. And the
  wrong-side rate was what turned eight bouts into sixteen: of the twenty rounds
  that produced an attributable swing, 11 were the hero's, so
  `0.55 × 0.25 ≈ 0.14`, about one usable bout in seven, and **0 usable
  direction-5 hero swings in 22 rounds** (one aborted before arming, one armed
  without a `damagecharacter` write) — a ~5% outcome, bad luck rather than a
  contradiction. **Budget from the repaired rate instead**: with villain swings
  refused rather than recorded, direction 5 is back to roughly 1 in 4 of the
  armed rounds (`randomBetween(5, 8)`), and **five** direction-5 hero captures
  arrived in the first batch behind the fix — `adc33`, `adc35`, `adc37`,
  `adc42`, `adc47` — four of them diverging on `staminaleft` and nothing else.
- **New, and measured: `staminaleft 105` diverges on every arena round so far.**
  **Eight** fixtures assert `staminaleft 105`, not five, and each asserts it on
  **both** combatants and in both `scenario` and `expected.state` — the five
  `candidate-armoured-*` of this group and the three `candidate-tournament-*`
  of Group I, which share the hero block (runbook §2). Measured:
  `grep -rl '"staminaleft": 105' test/fixtures/` returns ~~**53**~~ **54**
  files — those 8 plus 23 more candidates (31 in `ss2-1v1/`) and ~~22~~ **23**
  goldens; the new armoured golden is the 54th — and the villain's 105 in these eight
  is the hero's number copied across, not a villain-side derivation: the
  runbook's villain table warrants `staminamax 110` and has no `staminaleft` row
  at all. **Eleven** committed divergence reports for this family, not six —
  `candidate-armoured-deflection-threshold-cleared--obs-adc*-a1-*` under
  `test/fixtures/ss2-1v1-divergences/`. All eleven carry a
  `/scenario/villain/staminaleft` difference; seven carry the hero's too. Every
  observed value, expected 105 in each case:

  | round | hero | villain | everything else that differed |
  | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
  | `adc1` | 104 | 94 | direction 4, sample count, villain's swing |
  | `adc2` | 98 | 102 | direction 8 |
  | `adc3` | — | 102 | direction 10, villain's swing |
  | `adc4` | — | 90 | direction 11, villain's swing |
  | `adc5` | — | 110 | direction 8 |
  | `adc18` | 100 | 96 | villain's swing, `critical` not `normal` |
  | **`adc33`** | — | **95** | **nothing** |
  | **`adc35`** | **104** | **92** | **nothing** |
  | **`adc37`** | **108** | **100** | **nothing** |
  | **`adc42`** | **106** | **90** | **nothing** |
  | `adc47` | 106 | 93 | hero `hitpoints` 288 — a dent carried in from the villain's refused swing |

  **Corrected — this is no longer "the field that will still be standing".** The
  bottom five rows landed in `5a0d565`, one commit after this section was last
  revised, and they change what it says. Four of them —
  `adc33`, `adc35`, `adc37`, `adc42` — diverge on `staminaleft` and **nothing
  whatsoever else**: direction 5 landed, the side guard held, and the entire
  resolution chain matched (hit roll, `rollneeded`, dice roll, damage selection,
  critical determination, deflection roll and threshold, armour absorption, the
  mutation trace and both final states). `staminaleft` is the *only* field
  between this family and a match, and that is now measured five times over
  rather than argued.

  Note the hero's column: `106` and `108` are **above** 105, at `staminamax
  110`. Nothing that spends the approach can produce that, so "five walks from
  110" cannot be the rule even on the hero's side; the per-phase regen term
  simply outran `staminacost` on those bouts. Stamina is a
  per-phase quantity, re-read from the bytes for this revision: `nextphase`
  does `staminaleft -= staminacost` at `+0x32a7`–`+0x32c2` and then
  `staminaleft += 1 + Math.round(stamina / 3)` at `+0x32c3`–`+0x3304`, with
  `check_stats` clamping afterwards. **Both writes are on `game_attacker`
  only** (§*The staged fight that produced the goldens*), and
  `changeCombatants` re-binds `game_attacker` every phase, so each side's value
  at arming is a function of **its own** turn count. The hero's is a function of
  the approach the arena policy does not fix; the villain's is a function of
  what `villainChooseAction` decided, which the operator does not control at
  all and `-Autopilot` does not reach. That is the shape of the observed table:
  both columns straddle 105, and the villain's spans twice the range (90–110
  against the hero's 98–108) because nothing about it is steered.
  **This row is open**, and it is the cheapest thing a next session could
  settle: either re-author the fixtures' `staminaleft` from an observed arena
  bout (route 3, *capture first, author second*), or establish that the turn
  count can be pinned. Do not plan Group H as though staging alone clears it,
  and do not carry the hero's number onto the villain again — that is where the
  present 105 came from.
- **The clamp race is the one genuinely unproven part.** Staging `vitality:2`
  and `hitpoints:80` together is correct only if `battlevalues(villain)` runs
  before the last `check_stats(villain)` inside the 20-frame staging window.
  Repetition makes that likely, not certain. The failure mode is an ingest
  **refusal** naming the field rather than a silent match, which is the right
  way round — but do not plan as though it cannot happen.
- **Restore the base snapshot between every attempt.** Staging writes onto the
  ladder object, and a win advances `tournament_ranking`, which re-binds
  `game.villain` to a different one.

Per-fixture villain blocks, watch fields and the command lines are
[runbook §3](ss2-staging-runbook.md).

### Group I — `candidate-tournament-*` (3). Reachable now, and cheapest.

Same hero as Group H, direction 5, `normal_attack`, **no extra watch fields at
all**. These three exist to exercise the defeat gate's first-blood term, which
is why they are the first fixtures that *need* the mode rather than merely
tolerating it.

| Fixture | Villain | What it asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tournament-nonlethal-normal-hit` | `ac 0/0`, no pieces | 22 straight to hitpoints and **no result event** — the whole point |
| `tournament-boundary-at-max` | `ac 22/22`, helmet 2 + boot 1 | armour 22 → 1, hitpoints untouched |
| `tournament-boundary-below-max` | identical | armour 22 → −1, 1 hitpoint, clamp to 0 |

`tournament-nonlethal-normal-hit` stages no armour at all, so the only staging
is stripping whatever the generator drew. It is the single cheapest uncaptured
capture in the set. Treat a *mode* mismatch on any of the three as a finding,
not a failed run: ~~they would be the first ingested observation of
`fight_mode == "tournament"` in the archive.~~ ► **CORRECTED 2026-09-07: they
would not be the first.** Group H got there on 2026-09-02 — `obs-onx1405-a1`
and `obs-onx1521-a1` both record `fight_mode == "tournament"` and are both
committed and cited. Group I's three fixtures are still uncaptured, but the
*mode* is no longer unobserved, so a mode mismatch is now checkable against two
ingested records rather than against nothing.

### Group J — `candidate-champion-*` (5). Conditional on the hero, not the opponent.

The one bout in the build with a **reproducible** opponent. `unleash_hell`
builds `_root.game.champion` from a hard-coded `charDNA` literal with no RNG of
any kind, and `skincharacter` derives every combat field from it: `hitpointsmax`
110, `armourclass` 86, `min_damage` 20 / `max_damage` 44 from `weapon24`,
`helmet` 102 capped to `helmet_defence` 25 by the `helmet > 25` arm. Twelve
independent launches read the same numbers. Every value is decoded in
[the champion DNA map](ss2-champion-dna.md); this page adds only the staging.

**The hero is the part that is not free**, and it is what the whole family turns
on:

- experience per bout is a *generated* opponent's `character_xp`, so the hero
  levels 4 → 5 after the rank-2 bout in most runs but not all; and
  `staminaleft` carries across bouts, because `battlevalues` resets it only
  when it is already `<= 0`. Both are projected fields, so two sessions
  differing in either cannot match.
- The wrapper therefore **refuses to arm** unless `staminaleft == staminamax`
  and `herolevel == -ArenaStagedLevel`. It refused 382 times in one observed
  champion bout, for exactly those two reasons. A silent non-match becomes a
  visible refusal, which is the point.
- The staging is `-ArenaStagedLevel 5` plus a hero staged **on inputs only**:
  `herolevel 5`, `strength 30`, `weapon 24`, `attack 3`, `vitality 10`,
  `speed 2`, `stamina 5`, and eight armour zeroes. `speed 2` and `stamina 5`
  are chosen together so a walk phase costs less than `nextphase` restores,
  which is what lets the full-stamina gate ever pass.
- **Winning is not required.** The wrapper arms on the first `checkattackroll`
  and closes the trace on that call's return, so the evidence is one action.
  A vitality-only gladiator is 0 for 12 against this opponent and it does not
  matter.

Only three bands are reachable for this hero — quick (1–4), normal (5–8) and
power (9–12) — because nothing can start him in close range and the approach
turns are unavoidable. `psyche_up` is out at `herolevel 5`, and the bow
directions need a `swap_weapons` turn nobody has driven.

### Group B — the duel pair. Reachable in principle for the first time.

Ordinary arena duel with the operator's real gladiator (`fight_mode = "duel"`;
hero greaves 4 + boot 4, `armourclass_max 20`).

| Fixture | Direction/action | Staging notes | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate-duel-firstblood-normal-kill` | 8 (`normal_attack`) | duel against an unarmoured opponent with damage 8–20; the whole tape injected | **verified** — one matching observation (`obs-20260830-e1`) |
| `candidate-duel-absorbed-normal-hit` | 5 | duel against an opponent wearing helmet 2 + shield 2 (`armourclass_max 44`), damage 8–16; the hit must stay fully absorbed so the first-blood gate does not fire | **verified** for the opponent's existence (observed in a live duel), **open** for the fixture as written |

An earlier revision said of the first row that "a second independent session
against the same draw is all that stands between it and promotion", and the
revision after that called it a dead end:

> `randomise_gladiator` regenerates the duel opponent on every entry, using
> `RandomNumber` opcode draws the wrapper can neither record nor inject, so the
> same draw cannot be asked for — the campaign loop can retry an attack
> direction, but nothing can retry an opponent. **Neither Group B fixture has a
> route to the two-observation promotion gate**, and neither should be planned
> for.

**Every clause of that is still true about the generator, and the conclusion no
longer follows.** It was sound when the wrapper could only observe. Ingest
projects exactly the keys the fixture names, and `-StageVillain` can write every
one of them before the action arms, so the draw is overwritten before anything
compares it. The reasoning is kept because it is the record of why two
committed fixtures were written off.

What actually stands in the way now, in order of cost:

1. **A second, lower-level gladiator.** The duel button is hidden exactly when
   `herolevel >= tournament_level_required`, which is **4** for
   `current_tournament == 1`. So a level-4 gladiator cannot duel — observed
   ~~four~~ **five** times as `ABORT:duel-button-hidden` (one each in
   `arena-shop-2` through `arena-shop-6`), every one reading
   `"level":4,"required":4`.
   `herolevel` 2–3 duels; 4+ tournaments only, until tournament 1 is won. This
   is the real cost of the family, not the opponent.
2. **Two weapon ids, which this revision names.** `min_damage`/`max_damage` are
   outputs, so the villain's `weapon` id must be staged instead. From the
   decoded table: `duel-absorbed`'s villain (`strength 2`, 8/16) is
   `[3]/[4] = 4/12` → **`weapon41`**; `duel-firstblood`'s villain
   (`strength 2`, 8/20) is `4/16` → **`weapon2`**, **`weapon21`** or
   **`weapon61`** (61 is on no shop page, which does not matter for a staged
   villain). The hero on both (`strength 7`, 18/26) is also `4/12` → **41**,
   purchasable at `strength >= 3`. `-Stage* weapon:<n>` has never been run —
   the field is read by `battlevalues` at `+0x31be` so it should work, but the
   sprite and `weapon_range` side effects are unexamined.
3. **Hero armour**: greaves 4 + boot 4. Armour is level-gated
   (`itemlevel <= herolevel`), and greaves/boot item 4 is `itemlevel 1`, so a
   level-2 gladiator can buy both.

**Verdict: reachable in principle, lowest priority of the reachable set.**

### Groups C, D, E and F share one blocker, and it is not staging

The fifteen fixtures in these four groups all carry the same hero build —
`strength 5` with `min_damage 12` / `max_damage 20`, or `strength 9` with
`20 / 28` for `candidate-grievous-knockback`. Both imply a weapon whose
`[3]`/`[4]` are **2 and 10**, and *The weapon spread is a table lookup* above
shows no such row exists in the build.

**Sharpened for this revision: the contradiction is now a proof, not a failed
search**, and a reader should stop looking for a way round it. Both fixture
builds assert a `max_damage − min_damage` of **8**; that difference is
strength-free (`min` and `max` share the identical `Math.round(strength * 2)`
term, `+0x3356` and `+0x3386`), so it names the weapon row on its own; and
exactly one of the ninety authored rows has spread 8 — `weapon41`, `4 / 12`.
`weapon41` then forces `strength` **4** and **8**, not the 5 and 9 the fixtures
declare. `min_damage` is recomputed from `strength` and the weapon table by
`battlevalues`, which `nextphase` calls on **both** combatants at every phase
transition (`+0x35f1` attacker, `+0x3605` defender), so no staging survives to
the action and `strength` is projected too. **These fifteen cannot be captured
as written**, and no amount of shopping, staging or re-running changes that.
The group-by-group blockers below are all still real and still worth reading —
they are what remains once the hero is fixed — but none of them is the first
thing in the way any more.

The fix is a fixture edit and is outside this document's ownership. For the
record, the arithmetic that would work: `weapon41` (`4 / 12`) gives
`min 12 / max 20` at `strength` **4** and `min 20 / max 28` at `strength`
**8** — a one-token change to `scenario.hero.strength` in each file, with the
tape's damage-roll bounds unchanged.

### Group C — needs different equipment

Reachable with the same close-range warrior once the saved gladiator or the
opponent carries the right pieces. Each also needs a tournament fight unless
the hit is fully absorbed; the fight-mode column notes which. **Read every row
with the 2/10 hero caveat above.**

| Fixture | Direction/action | Equipment to stage | Also needs | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate-armour-overflow-burning` | 5 | hero weapon enchantment type 2, potency 5; villain breastplate 1, `armourclass 12` of `armourclass_max 16` | tournament (8 damage overflows to hitpoints). The worn armour is now **staged directly** — this row used to say "one extra uncontrolled exchange to wear the armour", which the `battle_started` guard makes unnecessary | **inferred** — map §Combatant state objects for the sum, §Hit and damage path for the overflow |
| `candidate-armour-equality-quirk` | 5 | villain armour totalling 12 (boot 6 is the fixture's implied build) | tournament — the quirk applies the full original damage to hitpoints *as well*; the damage roll must land exactly on 12, so the tape must be injected | **inferred** — map §Hit and damage path, transient/boundary note |
| `candidate-armour-removal-debris` | 5 | villain helmet 1 + shield 2 (`armourclass_max 34`) | nothing — 12 damage is fully absorbed, so any fight mode works. This is the most cheaply reachable Group C row | **inferred** |
| `candidate-deflection-threshold-discriminator` | 5 | villain helmet 10 + greaves 2 (`armourclass_max 106`) | tournament (the surviving critical bypasses armour); injected critical 20 and deflection 85 — the roll sits between the rival readings 83 < 85 < 87 and that is the entire point | **inferred** — map §Attack roll dispatcher, flagged operand mix |
| `candidate-power-critical-armour-bypass` | 9 (`power_attack`) | villain breastplate 1 (`armourclass_max 16`) | tournament; the critical sample must survive deflection at 20 | **inferred** |
| `candidate-frozen-enchantment-proc` | 5 | hero weapon enchantment type 3, potency 5 | tournament (12 damage reaches hitpoints) | **inferred** |

Enchanted weapons are hero-side staging: outfit the saved gladiator before the
session, or stage `weapon_enchantment_type` / `_potency` as numbers — untested.
`enchant_weapon` (`sprite:2023/frame:1`) is the game's own path.

**Corrected — "villain-side armour is not stageable" no longer holds.** This
paragraph used to end "read every row above as *inspect a tournament field for
it, or author the fixture from what turns up*", because the tutorial prisoner
is unarmoured and a generated opponent could not be chosen. Both premises still
hold; the conclusion does not. `-StageVillain` writes the pieces,
`armourclass` and `armourclass_max` directly, and because the re-sum sits
behind the `battle_started` guard the staged pool survives the whole bout. Read
every row above as "stage it" instead — with the caveat that the prisoner route
has no `-Stage*` script, so even `armour-removal-debris`, which needs no
tournament at all because its 12 damage is fully absorbed by 34 armour, has to
leave that route.

**Which script, now that `run-arena.ps1` carries `-WatchFields` too.** The two
staging vehicles are `run-arena.ps1` and `launch-capture.ps1`, and the choice is
decided by the direction, not by the watch fields. `run-arena.ps1` snapshots the
save itself but has no `-Autopilot`, and its policy issues only
`normal_attack` — so it can drive the direction-5 rows here
(`armour-overflow-burning`, `armour-equality-quirk`, `armour-removal-debris`,
`deflection-threshold-discriminator`, `frozen-enchantment-proc`) and cannot
drive `power-critical-armour-bypass` at direction 9. That one needs
`launch-capture.ps1 -Autopilot … -ArenaPolicy ''`, which has no snapshot guard —
snapshot by hand first. All of this is moot until the 2/10 hero is fixed;
it is recorded so the fix is not followed by a second wrong-vehicle session.

Four of the six also need extra `-WatchFields`, because they stage
`<piece>_defence` names the wrapper's 28-name default omits:
`helmet_defence,shield_defence` for `armour-removal-debris`, `boot_defence` for
`armour-equality-quirk`, `helmet_defence,greaves_defence` for
`deflection-threshold-discriminator`, and
`equipped_weapon,weapon_enchantment_type,weapon_enchantment_potency` for the
two enchantment rows.

`power-critical-armour-bypass` is direction **9**, and the arena route's
`aggressive` policy only ever issues `normal_attack` (`arenaPolicyStep` returns
that literal whenever the controller offers it). Reaching the power band needs
an explicit autopilot **and** an empty policy — and no session has ever driven
the arena route from an autopilot. That is open, and it is shared with Groups D,
E and F.

Two mechanics to get right before spending a window on it, both re-read for this
revision. **`-ArenaPolicy ''` is a no-op unless an autopilot is also given**: the
wrapper restores `"aggressive"` when the policy is empty *and* the step list is
empty, so the pair has to be passed together. And **only `launch-capture.ps1`
can pass them together** — `run-arena.ps1` has `-ArenaPolicy` but no
`-Autopilot`, so `run-arena.ps1 -ArenaPolicy ''` silently reverts to the
default. `launch-capture.ps1` has no snapshot guard; take the snapshot by hand.

### Group D — needs a secondary weapon and a `swap_weapons` turn

`bombardleft|right` and `snipeleft|right` live on controller frame 20
(`longrange_archer`) and `bash_attack` on frame 28 (`closerange_archer`).
The arena construction action forces `equipped_weapon = 1` and
`using_bow = false` for every fight (map §Battle entry), so a gladiator always
starts on a warrior controller and something has to flip it. This is equipment
plus one spent turn, not a wrapper change — but an earlier revision of this
heading said "needs the bow weapon mode ... a gladiator that owns a bow", and
that is stricter than the build:

- The only manual route to `using_bow` is the battle inventory overlay's
  `swap_inventory.onRelease` → `getphase("swap_weapons")`; no controller frame
  wires `swap_weapons` (map §Weapon mode and `swap_weapons`). The button is
  hidden when the hero has no secondary weapon, so **a secondary weapon of any
  kind** is the real gate — the `swap_weapons` phase never checks that it is a
  bow, it just sets `equipped_weapon = 2` and `using_bow = true`.
- Buying any weapon-shop item in the ranged band writes
  `hero.secondary_weapon`, and weapon bands are gated on an attribute
  (ranged on `speed`, displayed as Agility), **not** on level (arena route §6).
  The gate is now exact: **`3 * band_position <= hero.speed`** for the ranged
  and slashing bands, `<= hero.strength` for hacking and bashing; the
  `attribute_required` field the earlier reading tripped over does not hold a
  requirement, it holds a snapshot of the hero's own attribute. A ranged item
  is still the right staging, because `bombard`/`snipe` damage comes from
  `secondary_min_damage`/`secondary_max_damage` and the ranged phase decrements
  `ammo_left` — but the gate on *reaching* the archer controllers is weaker
  than this document assumed. Ranged id **61 is on no shop page** and can never
  be bought; 62 is the cheapest reachable one, at `speed >= 6`.
- **The shop refuses a vitality-only gladiator everything**, which is what a
  `level4-vitality-tournament-gate` snapshot is. Observed live as twenty-five
  successive refusals walking ids 40 down to 14. Stage `speed` or `strength` at
  the town square before the shop, not at battle start.
- The turn itself costs a phase. Budget `swap_weapons` as the autopilot's first
  step; the wrapper passes unrecognised labels through to `getphase` rather
  than blocking them, so `-Autopilot 'swap_weapons,…'` should reach it —
  **inferred**, never run.

| Fixture | Direction/action | Staging notes | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate-bombard-threshold` | 21 (`bombardleft`/`bombardright`) | secondary weapon swapped in; no armour either side; tournament (15 damage reaches hitpoints). Which of the two labels the direction comes from is unmapped, and ammunition/range staging is untested | **inferred** for the controller frame; **open** for left/right and range |
| `candidate-snipe-shield-boost` | 22 (`snipeleft`/`sniperight`) | secondary weapon swapped in **with shield 10 still equipped** — the flagged chance boost reads `game_attacker.shield`, while `battlevalues` scores the shield as 0 armour while `using_bow` (map §Combatant state objects, §Chance calculation). Tournament | **inferred**; **open** whether the shield stays equipped in bow mode |
| `candidate-bash-inherited-critical` | 23 (`bash_attack`) | a prior action must leave `criticalhit` at 20 and the transient must survive to this one; tournament | **inferred**; see the `shove` question below |

**Open — does `shove` also produce direction 23?** `shove` sits on *both*
`closerange_warrior` (frame 13) and `closerange_archer` (frame 28), and
neither the map nor the controller vocabulary records which
`attack_direction` it assigns. If `shove` is the direction-23 site, then
`candidate-bash-inherited-critical` leaves Group D entirely and becomes
reachable with the tutorial gladiator. One unattended round with
`-Autopilot 'walkright*5,shove'` settles it, because the wrapper records
`attack_direction` passively. On the tutorial gladiator that is a prisoner-route
round, so `run-capture.ps1 -Navigate prisoner -Autopilot 'walkright*5,shove'` —
which carries both flags. It does not snapshot, and the prisoner route still
flushes the store twice on the way in, so take the snapshot by hand, exactly as
*What a session costs* says to for every session.

### Group E — needs a tournament fight, a non-lethal finish, or both

No equipment problem; the blocker is the fight itself. Four of the five also
need the END-key non-lethal finish, which no capture has exercised yet (the
wrapper README lists it as not-yet-validated: every session so far ended
lethally). `candidate-lethal-result` is the exception — its action kills.

| Fixture | Direction/action | Staging notes | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate-normal-threshold-hit` | 5 (`normal_attack`) | no armour either side, both attack 11 / defence 11 (chance 50); villain 40 hp. Tournament — 12 damage reaches hitpoints and the fixture expects no defeat | **inferred** |
| `candidate-normal-miss-roll-order` | 5 | same pair; the hit roll must miss. A miss touches no hitpoints, so the defeat gate never opens — this and `candidate-armour-removal-debris` are the only two legacy candidates reachable in any fight mode. It needs the miss (passive, or an injected 49) and the non-lethal finish | **inferred** |
| `candidate-quick-threshold-profile` | 2 (`quick_attack`) | no armour; threshold diceroll 34 injected; tournament | **inferred** |
| `candidate-lethal-result` | 5 | villain pre-damaged to 12 of 40 **and** already `burning`. The pre-damage is no longer a problem — `check_stats` clamps `hitpoints` *down* only, so `hitpoints:12` stages cleanly. The `burning` flag is; see below. The action itself is lethal, so no END-key finish is needed | **inferred**, and **blocked** on the boolean |
| `candidate-taunt-charisma-floor` | 20 (`taunt`) | hero charisma 5 vs villain charisma 30; the 1–3 floor roll must be injected; tournament. `taunt` is on `longrange_warrior` (frame 13 is not needed) so it is reachable *without* walking into close range and without a bow — drop the walks from the autopilot | **open** — see the tension below |

**Blocked — boolean statuses cannot be staged.** `parseStageList` refuses any
value `isNum` rejects and emits a `stage-refused … "why":"not-a-number"` line
rather than writing it, so `-StageVillain "burning:true"` writes nothing at
all. `burning:1` writes the *number* 1, and the wrapper's
`normalizeFieldValue` only maps `undefined` → `false` for the six status names
— it does not map 1 → `true` — so the staged dump would report `1` against the
fixture's `true` and ingest would diverge. Three fixtures are affected:
`candidate-lethal-result`, `candidate-spell-first-blood-duel` and
`candidate-spell-lethal-slain`. The options are (a) let the game set the flag
by taking an uncontrolled exchange against an enchanted opponent first —
uncontrollable, (b) a one-line wrapper change to pass `true`/`false` through
unconverted. **(b) is out of this document's ownership; it is reported, not
made.**

**Open — is the direction-20 taunt observable at all?** The runtime-capture
workflow lists "range taunts and other opcode-rolled paths" as out of scope
because they make no `randomBetween` call, while the same document's campaign
section records `taunt 20` as a fixed `attack_direction` assignment at
`+0x6981` and the map's dispatcher table gives direction 20 both a
`taunt_percentage` and a `randomBetween(1, 3)` floor roll. Those cannot both
describe the same code path. This has since been narrowed rather than settled:
the taunt phase reaches the `+0x6981` assignment only when
`taunt_effect = randomBetween(1, 2)` returns 1 at `+0x6952`, and that draw
happens **before** arming, so it is uninjectable — half of all taunts never
reach the dispatcher at all, on top of the `taunt_percentage` comparison and
the 60-tick `taunttimer` watchdog. One unattended round with
`-Autopilot 'taunt' -ArenaPolicy ''` still resolves it: either the trace
records `attack_direction = 20` with the mapped rolls, or it records no
`randomBetween` call and the fixture is genuinely unreachable.

**Which script.** That pair only takes effect together — the wrapper restores
`"aggressive"` when the policy is empty *and* the step list is empty — and only
`launch-capture.ps1` exposes both, so it is
`launch-capture.ps1 -Autopilot 'taunt' -ArenaPolicy '' …` with the arena
`-Navigate`/`-ArenaTarget` flags, and a hand-taken snapshot first because that
script has no guard. Passing `-ArenaPolicy ''` to `run-arena.ps1` instead does
nothing at all: it has no `-Autopilot`, so the wrapper puts the default back.

**The arena archive has already narrowed this, on the villain's side.** Three of
the twenty-two `session-adc*` rounds recorded `attack_direction = 20` — `adc7`,
`adc20`, `adc21`, all villain swings. Arming happens at `checkattackroll`, so
direction 20 demonstrably reaches `checkattackroll`; and each of those three
armed windows served exactly four tape samples with `"overdraw":0`, the same
count as the direction-8 rounds, so the path makes four `randomBetween` calls
after arming rather than none. That kills the "records no `randomBetween` call"
branch of the question above. It does **not** settle the fixture, for two
reasons that must not be elided: the `label`, `min`, `max` and `value` of those
roll lines are echoed from the injected tape and are not observations of what
the game drew, so they cannot tell you *which* four calls those were; and all
three are the villain's taunt, so whether a **hero-side** `getphase("taunt")`
arms at all is exactly what the unattended round still has to show.

### Group F — needs the `psyche_up` discharge chain

**Correction, and it is now confirmed from the bytes rather than from the map.**
This group used to read "no player action is known to produce the direction",
and cited the absence of a `getphase` label mapping to direction 30. That was
wrong. Re-read for this revision in `sprite:862[overlay]`:

- the `psyche_up` phase writes `attack_direction = 30` and then calls
  `checkattackroll()` at **two** sites, one per facing — `+0x669e`/`+0x66a9`
  and `+0x6717`/`+0x6722`, each behind the range gate;
- `psyche_up` **is** a `getphase` label: `Push "psyche_up", 1, "getphase";
  CallFunction` appears on both facings of controller frame 5
  (`+0x0dec`, `+0x127e`) and both facings of frame 13 (`+0x0b8b`, `+0x0f95`),
  and the archer frames the same way;
- the gate is a `_visible` test on the slot, not on the phase: frame 13 facing
  right hides `optionG` below `herolevel` 3 (`+0x0785`… `Push 3`) and
  `optionH` — the `psyche_up` slot — below `herolevel` **7**
  (`+0x07ba`… `Push 7`). Frame 28 uses `Push 3` for the same slots.

Direction 30 is not unreachable. It is a levelled-gladiator unlock.

| Fixture | Direction/action | Staging notes | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate-grievous-knockback` | 30 (grievous) | hero strength 9 with a 2/10 weapon — **which does not exist**, see Groups C–F above; villain breastplate 1, 50 hp, `armourclass 4` of `armourclass_max 16`, now directly stageable (the knockback force uses the overflow remainder, not the selected damage — map §Attack roll dispatcher). Tournament, and the discharge chain below | **inferred** — the direction's producer and its gating are byte-verified; no session has yet driven `psyche_up` at all |

What reaching direction 30 now requires, in order of cost:

1. **A gladiator whose controller wires `psyche_up`.** It is hidden below
   `herolevel` 7 on the two warrior controllers and below `herolevel` 3 on the
   two archer controllers (map §Buttons wired per controller frame). Level 7
   with any weapon, or level 3 with a secondary weapon swapped in, are the two
   cheapest doors. Whether that gate binds an *autopilot* is a separate
   question — see below.
2. **Range.** `psyche_up` is one of only two phases that gate on distance,
   comparing `attacker._x` against `defender._x -/+ round(weapon_range + 50)`
   by facing. Out of range the phase decides nothing at all: no roll, no
   damage, no death. That threshold is wider than the close-range controller's,
   so `walkright*5` already satisfies it.
3. **Three uninterrupted `psyche_up` turns.** The counter plays `psyche_up`,
   `psyche_up2`, `psyche_up3` at values 1, 2 and >= 3, and only the third
   discharges the grievous. Any non-`psyche_up` hero decision resets the
   counter through `nextphase`, and **any damage the hero takes resets it**
   through `damagecharacter`. So the autopilot is five walks followed by
   `psyche_up` three times over, and it is fragile: one connecting blow from
   the opponent during those three turns and the count restarts at 1. This,
   not the direction, is the real staging cost.
4. **The fixture's own scenario.** This used to be listed as "a Group C/E
   problem on top", and two thirds of it has since dissolved: the armoured
   opponent worn to 4 of 16 is now a two-field `-StageVillain` write rather
   than an exchange to engineer, and `tournament` mode is a routing choice.
   What is left is the hero's nonexistent 2/10 weapon, which is a fixture
   problem rather than a staging one.

Two things a first `psyche_up` session would settle for free. The map records a
**static candidate** that after a discharge the counter is written back to 1
and then incremented again in a later tick of the same phase, landing on 2
rather than 1 and so shortening the *next* chain; two consecutive presses
recorded live decide it. And it would resolve the tension in item 1: the
herolevel test hides the *button*, while the map's byte-verified note says the
phase machine never consults the controller frame, so a driver calling
`getphase("psyche_up")` should reach the phase whatever the level. The
wrapper's own readiness model assumes the opposite and would report a stall.
**Open**, and cheap — one unattended round on the tutorial gladiator, which is
level 1 and therefore below both gates, distinguishes the two outcomes
outright. That is a prisoner-route round:
`run-capture.ps1 -Navigate prisoner -Autopilot 'walkright*5,psyche_up*3'`.
The `label*N` form is the parser's own (`autopilot=walkright*5,normal_attack`),
so the three presses do not have to be written out. It is the same vehicle as
the `shove` round above and can share a window; neither needs `-Stage*`, so
neither needs the arena route. Snapshot the save first, as for any session.

`cast_whirlwind` also writes 30, at `+0x79d0`/`+0x7a49` behind the same range
gate, but it is a `cast_*` phase label with no autopilot route (Group G,
blocker 2), so it is not a second door.

`chargeleft`/`chargeright` remain not the answer: charge impacts were observed
live with `attack_direction` **undefined**, not 30 — the charge sites write the
value as a member on the fighter clip, and `checkattackroll` reads the overlay
timeline variable and never sees it (map §Where `attack_direction` is assigned,
runtime-observed note).

### Group G — spell ingress

All eight replay through `resolveSs2SpellDamageCandidate` and carry
`scenario.spellId` (the caller's inventory id), not an attack direction:
`magic_damage_character` has no direction chain (map §Spell ingress). The
ingress makes no RNG call of its own, so the single tape sample belongs to the
caller's mapped `randomBetween` range.

| Fixture | Spell (id) | Staging notes | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate-spell-fireball-armour-absorbed` | fireball (30) | duel; villain helmet 6 + shield 5 (`armourclass_max 120`) absorbs 100 — the absorbed hit must not trip the first-blood gate | **inferred** |
| `candidate-spell-breastplate-stamina-absorbed` | lightning bolt (34) | tournament; **villain casts**; hero breastplate 7 (`armourclass_max 112`) absorbs 100 and still gains stamina | **inferred** |
| `candidate-spell-armour-equality-quirk` | fireball (30) | tournament; villain armour exactly 120 and the roll exactly 120 — injection required | **inferred** |
| `candidate-spell-armour-overflow-remainder` | fireball (30) | tournament; same 120 armour, roll 121, so exactly 1 overflows | **inferred** |
| `candidate-spell-armour-depleted-full-damage` | lightning bolt (34) | tournament; villain breastplate 3 + helmet 6 (`armourclass_max 108`) already worn to 0 mid-battle | **inferred** |
| `candidate-spell-raw-fractional-damage` | fireball (30) | villain `armourclass 90.5` of 96 (breastplate 6) | **open** — flagged `synthetic-fractional-armour`; every mapped direct-damage spell rolls an integer and the physical path ceils, so no mapped route to a fractional `armourclass` is known. Settled by a live capture that records one, or by mapping a caller that applies fractional armour damage |
| `candidate-spell-first-blood-duel` | fireball (30) | duel; villain unarmoured and already `burning`, hero already `taunted1`; 80 damage reaches hitpoints and yields | **inferred** |
| `candidate-spell-lethal-slain` | dire fireball (32) | `misc`; **villain casts**; hero breastplate 6 (`armourclass_max 96`) and already `poison`; 400 damage leaves 304 after armour and kills | **inferred** |

Four blockers apply to the whole group. The first has been closed since this
list was written; the second and third are new here and are the real ones.

1. ~~**The trace carries no `spell_id`.**~~ ~~**Closed.** The wrapper now emits
   it in `beginAction`, reading `overlay.spell_id` and falling back to
   `_global.spell_id`, and ingest reads it from the same `var` line. This was
   the item the list called "small"; it was, and it is done.~~

   ► **THE RETRACTION IS ITSELF WRONG — corrected 2026-09-07, and the wrapper
   said so one day before this "Closed" was written.** The two reads exist
   (`ss2-capture-wrapper.as:2256-2260`) but **can never fire**. The comment
   directly above them, byte-verified in `7601888` on 2026-08-30, is headed
   *"WITHDRAWN CLAIM"* and reads: *"`spell_id` DOES NOT EXIST anywhere in the
   build. A whole-file reference scan for `/spell_id|spell_number/` returns
   exactly one hit — the `spell_number` PARAMETER of
   `cast_spell_icon(which_avatar, spell_number)` … So both branches below are
   permanently undefined and no spell trace can carry an action identity."*
   **Blocker 1 is OPEN.** The id is readable, but only as `cast_spell_icon`'s
   second argument, which means wrapping the ARMING path — deliberately not
   done. *An emit that cannot fire is not a closed blocker; it is a closed
   blocker's costume.*

2. ~~**The wrapper emits no `magic-damage` event, so ingest cannot key the
   dispatch.**~~ ► **CLOSED 2026-08-30 in `7601888`; corrected here
   2026-09-07.** `deriveExpectedEventsFromSs2Fixture` pushes
   `{ type: "magic-damage", … }` for every fixture carrying `scenario.spellId`,
   and ingest keys the death dispatch on
   `events.some(e => e.type === "magic-damage")` — and the wrapper now meets it.
   `ss2-capture-wrapper.as:2447-2450` registers
   `registerSlot(…, "magic_damage_character", makeHookMaker("magic-damage-character", …))`
   and emits
   `{ t: "event", type: "magic-damage", method: spellDamageMethod(args[4]) }`
   when armed. **The label is `"magic-damage-character"`, not `"damagecharacter"`,
   and the two-line snippet quoted below no longer exists in the file.** What
   remains for the spell family is blocker 1 (a readable action identity) and an
   arming site on the spell ingress.

   *The superseded text, kept because two other pages cite it:* ~~the hook is
   registered as `registerSlot(…, "magic_damage_character",
   makeHookMaker("damagecharacter"))`, so a spell trace emits the *physical*
   label and never the event it needs.~~
3. **The recording window never opens on a cast.** `beginAction()` is called
   from exactly two sites — the `attack_chances` hook and the `checkattackroll`
   hook. `magic_damage_character` runs through neither, and `check_spells` is
   hooked without arming. Nothing about the spell ingress is observable until
   an arming site exists.
4. **No autopilot route to a hero-side cast.** The `cast_*` strings are
   `phase_decision` labels consumed by the attacker's `onEnterFrame` state
   machine, and there is no callable `cast_spell` function (map §Spell and
   vanilla AI surface). No `getphase` label casts anything, so the autopilot
   cannot reach a cast the way it reaches `normal_attack`; the battle
   inventory overlay would have to be driven instead.
5. **Villain-side casts cannot be forced.** `villain_cast_spells` rolls an
   inclusive 1–100 and enters its fixed-priority item chain only above 10 (map
   §Spell and vanilla AI surface). That roll is a `randomBetween` call the
   fixtures do not carry, so a villain-cast capture is expected to record at
   least one sample ahead of the fixture's — an **inference** that the first
   spell trace will confirm or refute. Both villain-cast fixtures also need
   the spell in the opponent's inventory, which is a draw, not a setting.

Every mapped direct-damage spell also needs high magicka and the item in
inventory, and the fixtures' hitpoint totals (150–300) imply gladiators well
beyond the tutorial pair.

**Verdict: 8 of 8 blocked in the wrapper, not on staging** — and unlike every
other blocker on this page, this one has a small, named fix (an event emission
on the `magic_damage_character` hook plus an arming site). Two of the eight
carry the boolean-status blocker on top, and one — `spell-raw-fractional-damage`
— became *newly reachable in principle* the day staging arrived, since
`Number("90.5")` parses and staging is now the only known route to a fractional
`armourclass`. All of that is moot until the ingress arms. **The wrapper edits
are not this document's to make.**

## Wrapper launch values

`node tools/capture-session.mjs tape --fixture <candidate.json>` prints the
`tape` FlashVars string for the wrapper (randomBetween samples only — opcode
debris rolls are neither injectable nor recordable). For a whole family,
`node tools/runtime-capture/campaign.mjs seed` nominates the tape instead, and
refuses when a family's members disagree about their injectable samples.

The other launch values (ids, timestamps, `hashBefore`) come from the session
protocol; the post-session hash attestation is stamped by `ingest`, never at
launch. `attack_direction` is never a launch value — it is observed.

`launch-capture.ps1` derives the tape from `-FixturePath` itself, so a session
driven through it never passes a tape by hand. The `armoured-*`,
`removal-destroys-*` and `tournament-boundary-*` pairs differ only in one
injected sample while sharing `attackDirection 5`, so a two-member family both
collides on the action key and disagrees about its tape: **run each as a
one-member family**, using the full fixture id as `--family`.

**Do not hand-transcribe a `-WatchFields` value from this page.**
`node tools/runtime-capture/campaign.mjs watch-fields --family <f>` derives it,
by diffing the fixture's staged field names against the wrapper's own
`DEFAULT_WATCH_FIELDS` read out of the source — so it cannot drift from either
the fixture or the 28-name default the way a table here can. Empty output is a
real answer, and exit 0, meaning the default list is enough. It refuses when a
family's members disagree, for the same reason `seed` does: a watch fires per
assignment, so a field watched for member A can add a mutation line to member
B's trace. Every list this page names was re-derived through it for this
revision and all of them agree (up to ordering, which the tool sorts):

| `--family` | derived `-WatchFields` |
| --- | --- |
| `armoured-deflection-threshold-cleared` | *(empty — default is enough)* |
| `armoured-removal-destroys-helmet` | `helmet_defence,shoulderguard_defence` |
| `tournament-nonlethal-normal-hit`, `tournament-boundary-at-max` | *(empty)* |
| `armour-removal-debris` | `helmet_defence,shield_defence` |
| `armour-equality-quirk` | `boot_defence` |
| `deflection-threshold-discriminator` | `greaves_defence,helmet_defence` |
| `armour-overflow-burning`, `frozen-enchantment-proc` | `equipped_weapon,weapon_enchantment_potency,weapon_enchantment_type` |
| `power-critical-armour-bypass` | *(empty)* |
| `champion-deflection-threshold-discriminator` | the eleven names `run-arena.ps1`'s header example carries |

## What is still genuinely unreachable, and what would unblock it

| Fixtures | Needs |
| --- | --- |
| the 15 in Groups C, D, E and F | a hero whose `strength` / `min_damage` / `max_damage` triple matches a real weapon row. A fixture edit |
| all 8 `candidate-spell-*` | ~~a `magic-damage` event on the `magic_damage_character` hook, and~~ **the `magic-damage` event half is BUILT** (`ss2-capture-wrapper.as:2447-2450`, commit `7601888`, 2026-08-30). What is still needed is (a) an arming site on the spell ingress and (b) a readable action identity — `spell_id` does not exist in this build, so it has to come from `cast_spell_icon`'s second argument, which is an ARMING-path change. A wrapper edit *(corrected 2026-09-07)* |
| `candidate-lethal-result`, `candidate-spell-first-blood-duel`, `candidate-spell-lethal-slain` | `-Stage*` to pass `true`/`false` through unconverted. A wrapper edit |
| `candidate-taunt-charisma-floor` | proof that direction 20 arms at all — `taunt_effect` is drawn pre-arm |
| `candidate-grievous-knockback` | proof that `getphase("psyche_up")` reaches the phase below `herolevel 7` |
| `candidate-bash-inherited-critical` | a secondary weapon, or proof that `shove` produces direction 23 |
| every non-`normal_attack` direction on the arena route | one run proving `-Autopilot` with `-ArenaPolicy ''` drives it, through `launch-capture.ps1` — `run-arena.ps1` cannot pass the pair. Never done |
| the duel pair | a second gladiator at `herolevel` 2–3 |
| the 5 `candidate-champion-*` | **open** — either a run that contradicts the hero table under Group J, or fixtures re-derived from `attack 1` / `defence 1` / `stamina 1` and a reachable `(herolevel, vitality)` pair |
| the 5 `candidate-armoured-*` | nothing in staging, and since the wrong-side guard was repaired nothing in sampling either — **only** a `staminaleft` the fixtures and the arena route disagree about, measured five times over on clean direction-5 hero captures |

Nothing on this page any longer claims a fixture is unreachable because its
opponent cannot be chosen, because parallel capture is impossible, or because
`fight_mode == "tournament"` cannot be reached. All three were true once and
none is true now.

**And one caution about this page's own genre.** Three separate claims here have
now been overturned in the same direction — a blocker that was recorded as
permanent turned out to be a capability that had not been built yet. The
correction that is not symmetrical: this revision found two claims overturned
the *other* way (a fixture family recorded as "reachable now" that twenty-two
live rounds could not reach, and a wrapper guard recorded as absent that exists
and does nothing). Prefer a measured rate to a verdict wherever this page offers
both.
