# SS2 weapon and armour item tables, and the shop gates

Status: read-only static map, recorded 2026-08-30. Completes section 6
("Equipment") of [the arena route map](ss2-arena-route.md); same licensed build,
same [fingerprint](ss2-build-fingerprint.json), same inspection boundary.

Everything below was read from the installed
`swf/swords_sandals2_download.swf` in place. Nothing was launched, patched,
copied or exported; no save was touched. Every claim carries a
`sprite:<id>/frame:<n>/DoAction@<addr>` context and a `+0x....` instruction
offset within that block, and every number is either an authored numeric
literal or arithmetic derived from one.

**§2.3 and §2.4 are now RE-DERIVABLE rather than trusted, and this document is
load-bearing enough that they had to be.** Run

```
node tools/item-table-transcription.mjs
```

on a machine that has the licensed build. It walks the nested action bodies,
finds every `_root.weapon<N> = Array(...)` literal by shape rather than by
address, and diffs all **540 fields of all 90 rows** — the instruction offset
included, so a silently renumbered row fails rather than passes. It then checks
the part a diff alone cannot: that the **index convention is the build's**, by
reading the `Push <n>; GetMember` at each `battlevalues` reader site rather than
assuming §2.1's `[e, name, d, c, b, a]`. Measured 2026-09-02 against
`77cb545c…`: 540 of 540 fields agree, and all five reader indices agree
(`weapon_type` 0 at `+0x3134`, `weapon_weight` 2 at `+0x3186`,
`weapon_min_damage` 3 at `+0x31d0`, `weapon_max_damage` 4 at `+0x31ec`,
`weapon_range` 5 at `+0x31aa`).

It is a tool rather than a test because a fresh clone has no licensed build, and
this project's rule is that for build DATA the only honest oracle is the build.

**Inspection boundary note.** Each weapon and armour item also carries a
**display-name string literal**. Names are game content, not structure, so this
document does not reproduce any of them — items are identified by **id** only,
exactly as the wrapper addresses them. The same is true of the shopkeeper
dialogue and the refusal texts, which appear below as `<refusal text>`. Anyone
reproducing the inventory with the commands in the last section will see the
names in their own terminal; they do not belong in the repository.

## 0. The answer the route needs

### 0.1 The formula this is all in service of

`battlevalues` (`root/frame:35/DoAction@0x3fa9dc`) derives, for a character
`c` (register 3), with `_root` in register 1 and `_global` in register 2:

```text
c.weapon_type       = _root["weapon" + c.weapon][0]                  // +0x3122
c.weapon_name       = _root["weapon" + c.weapon][1]                  // +0x3142
c.weapon_typename   = _root.weapontypes[c.weapon_type]               // +0x315e
c.weapon_weight     = _root["weapon" + c.weapon][2]                  // +0x3174
c.weapon_range      = c.physical_size
                    + _root["weapon" + c.weapon][5] * 44             // +0x3190
                    // ^ ONE STATEMENT, WRAPPED. There is no unarmed branch:
                    //   every character has a `weapon`, the smallest `[5]` in
                    //   all ninety rows is 1, and `physical_size` alone is the
                    //   reach of nothing. `src/team/ss2-rules.js`'s `ss2Reach`
                    //   cited the first of these two lines for "an unarmed
                    //   gladiator's weapon_range is exactly physical_size" and
                    //   shipped that for twelve days (corrected 2026-09-11).
c.weapon_min_damage = _root["weapon" + c.weapon][3]                  // +0x31be
c.weapon_max_damage = _root["weapon" + c.weapon][4]                  // +0x31da

c.min_damage = Math.round(c.strength * 2) + c.weapon_min_damage      // +0x3356
c.max_damage = Math.round(c.strength * 2) + c.weapon_max_damage      // +0x3386
```

**Two corrections to the brief this task was written from:**

1. The multiplier on strength is **2**, not 1 (`Push 2; Multiply` at `+0x3362`
   and `+0x3392`). The secondary pair uses **1** (`+0x33c2`, `+0x33f2`).
2. There is no `weapons` array and no `weapon_min_damage` field in the table.
   The table is **80 separate root variables** `_root.weapon1` … `_root.weapon80`
   (plus `weapon0` and nine off-shop ids), each a 6-element `Array`. The
   `weapon_*` names are the *outputs* `battlevalues` writes onto the character.

So the input the route can actually change is `hero.weapon` — a small integer —
and the shop is the only path that writes it for the hero from a purchase.

### 0.2 The recommendation

**`-ShopWeapon 20`, and it is useless without staging an attribute first.**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Recommended id | **20** — slashing band, `weap_i` 20, `itemlevel` 60, `[3]/[4]` = **26 / 676** |
| Attribute needed | **`hero.speed >= 60`** (Agility). Staged, e.g. `-StageHero "speed:60"` |
| Resulting battle damage | `min_damage = 2*strength + 26`, `max_damage = 2*strength + 676` |
| Shop cost before discounts | 94 538 gold — well inside a staged `-StageGold` |
| Page it lives on | `slashing3` (sprite 1961 frame **116**) |

Id 20 has the **highest `[4]` (max damage) of any of the 80 shop items**, and
from `weap_i >= 3` upward the slashing band beats both strength bands on `[4]`
at every equal `weap_i`. Its `[3]` (min damage) is low — 26 — so if the operator
wants a high *floor* instead of a high *ceiling*, the alternative is **id 40**
(`strength >= 60`, 170 / 440) or **id 60** (`strength >= 60`, 160 / 480).

**With base attributes, no weapon at all is purchasable.** A newly created
gladiator starts at `strength = speed = 1` (`heroDNA` literal, indices 16 and
17 — see §6) plus 9 creation points and per-level points; the cheapest item in
every band has `itemlevel = 3` and the gate is `itemlevel <= attribute`. The
project's `level4-vitality-tournament-gate` snapshot spent everything on
vitality, so **every one of its shop attempts is refused** — which is exactly
what capture `arena-shop-3` recorded: nine pages walked, `shop-exhausted` with
`"tries":25`, not one purchase.

### 0.3 Best candidates at several attribute levels

Primary weapon only (the ranged band writes `secondary_weapon`, not `weapon` —
see §4.4). `A` is whichever attribute governs the band: `speed` for slashing,
`strength` for hacking and bashing. Allowed band position is
`weap_i <= floor(A / 3)`.

| A | best `[4]` | 2nd | 3rd |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | **21** hacking 4/16 | 41 bashing 4/12 | 1 slashing 3/9 |
| 6 | **22** hacking 5/20 | 2 slashing 4/16 | 21 hacking 4/16 |
| 9 | **3** slashing 5/25 | 23 hacking 6/24 | 43 bashing 8/24 |
| 12 | **4** slashing 6/36 | 24 hacking 8/32 | 44 bashing 10/30 |
| 15 | **5** slashing 7/49 | 45 bashing 15/45 | 25 hacking 10/40 |
| 18 | **6** slashing 8/64 | 26 hacking 15/60 | 46 bashing 20/60 |
| 24 | **8** slashing 10/100 | 48 bashing 30/90 | 7 slashing 9/81 |
| 30 | **10** slashing 14/196 | 9 slashing 12/144 | 30 hacking 30/120 |
| 36 | **12** slashing 18/324 | 11 slashing 16/256 | 10 slashing 14/196 |
| 42 | **14** slashing 20/400 | 13 slashing 19/361 | 12 slashing 18/324 |
| 48 | **16** slashing 22/484 | 15 slashing 21/441 | 14 slashing 20/400 |
| 54 | **18** slashing 24/576 | 17 slashing 23/529 | 16 slashing 22/484 |
| 57 | **19** slashing 25/625 | 18 slashing 24/576 | 17 slashing 23/529 |
| **60** | **20 slashing 26/676** | 19 slashing 25/625 | 18 slashing 24/576 |

The strength bands never top the table above `weap_i` 2, but they carry a far
higher `[3]`. If the operator wants a damage *floor* rather than a ceiling, the
`weap_i`-20 strength picks are id **40** (170/440) and id **60** (160/480)
against id 20's 26/676.

Ranged band, for a *secondary* weapon (`speed` gated, and **id 61 is not
purchasable at all** — see §3.4):

| `speed` | best ranged id | `[3]/[4]` |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 6 | 62 | 5 / 25 |
| 12 | 64 | 7 / 49 |
| 24 | 68 | 11 / 121 |
| 36 | 72 | 15 / 225 |
| 48 | 76 | 19 / 361 |
| 60 | 80 | 23 / 529 |

### 0.4 Armour, same question

The armour gate is `itemlevel <= hero.herolevel`, and armour `itemlevel` is a
**step function of the item number** (§3.2), not `n * 3`:

| item number | 2–4 | 5–6 | 7–9 | 10–12 | 13–15 | 16–18 | 19–21 | 22–24 | 25 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `itemlevel` | 1 | 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30 | 36 | 42 | 48 |

**A herolevel 4–5 gladiator can buy item numbers 2, 3 and 4 only** — the
`itemlevel 1` tier. Item 5 needs herolevel 6. A full set-4 kit across all eight
pieces is `armourclass` **248** for 30 624 gold before discounts (§5.3).
`-ShopArmour 4` is therefore the ceiling at level 4–5, and nothing the operator
can stage changes it short of staging `herolevel` itself.

---

## 1. Are the per-item handlers wired for all ids? **No.**

This is the answer to the live stall, and it has two independent parts.

### 1.1 `weaponbuttons()` is never called on the `browse` page

Whole-build reference check on the name (`--references '"value":"weaponbuttons"'`):
**13 hits, one definition and twelve calls**, and every call is on a *category
page* frame:

| Called at | Frame label |
| --- | --- |
| `sprite:1961/frame:48/DoAction@0x612e90` `+0x0000` | `bashing1` |
| `sprite:1961/frame:56/DoAction@0x613016` `+0x0000` | `bashing2` |
| `sprite:1961/frame:64/DoAction@0x61310a` `+0x0000` | `bashing3` |
| `sprite:1961/frame:72/DoAction@0x613215` `+0x0000` | `hacking1` |
| `sprite:1961/frame:80/DoAction@0x613377` `+0x0000` | `hacking2` |
| `sprite:1961/frame:88/DoAction@0x613487` `+0x0000` | `hacking3` |
| `sprite:1961/frame:96/DoAction@0x613575` `+0x0000` | `slashing1` |
| `sprite:1961/frame:106/DoAction@0x6136b7` `+0x0000` | `slashing2` |
| `sprite:1961/frame:116/DoAction@0x6137c6` `+0x0000` | `slashing3` |
| `sprite:1961/frame:124/DoAction@0x6138d2` `+0x0000` | `ranged1` |
| `sprite:1961/frame:131/DoAction@0x613a31` `+0x0000` | `ranged2` |
| `sprite:1961/frame:139/DoAction@0x613b1e` `+0x0000` | `ranged3` |

There is **no call at `enter` (1), `browse` (26), `angry` (27), `buy` (37) or
`getitem` (147)**. The armoury is the same shape: `armourbuttons()` has 21 hits,
one definition at `sprite:1909/frame:1/DoAction@0x5f1fa9` `+0x0786` and twenty
calls, each at `+0x0016` of a per-piece page frame (48, 56, 64, 71, 79, 86, 93,
99, 105, 111, 117, 124, 131, 138, 146, 152, 158, 164, 171, 177).

### 1.2 Even on a page, only that page's item clips exist

`weaponbuttons()` loops `i = 1..80` (`+0x05a6` `Push 80; Greater; Not; Not; If`,
loop back at `+0x0982`) and assigns to `this["item" + i]`. In AVM1 a
`SetMember` on `undefined` is a silent no-op, so **ids not placed on the current
frame get nothing** — no `itemlevel`, no `attribute_required`, no `onRollOver`,
no `onRelease`.

`PlaceObject2` instance names per frame in sprite 1961:

| Frame | Label | Item clips placed |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 48 | `bashing1` | 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 |
| 56 | `bashing2` | 49 50 51 52 53 |
| 64 | `bashing3` | 54 55 56 57 58 60 |
| 72 | `hacking1` | 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 |
| 80 | `hacking2` | 30 31 32 33 35 40 |
| 88 | `hacking3` | 34 36 37 38 39 |
| 96 | `slashing1` | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 |
| 106 | `slashing2` | 9 10 11 12 13 14 |
| 116 | `slashing3` | 15 16 17 18 19 20 |
| 124 | `ranged1` | 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 |
| 131 | `ranged2` | 71 72 73 74 75 |
| 139 | `ranged3` | 76 77 78 79 80 |

Note the pages are **not in id order** — 34 sits on `hacking3` while 35 and 40
sit on `hacking2`.

**Ids 59 and 61 are placed on no page at all**, so they can never be bought.
(59 would be `strength >= 57`, 140/420; 61 would be `speed >= 3`, 4/16.)

### 1.3 This replicates against the project's own capture logs

`captures/arena-shop-2/arena-shop-2-obs-a1.rufflelog` enumerated the weaponsmith
clip's own properties at shop frames **38** and **47** (between `buy` and
`bashing1`):

```text
"step":"shop-no-handlers", ... "shopFrame":38, "props":
  "initbubbletext bubbletext buyweapon getweaponinfo weaponbuttons coins_text
   instance431 instance437 ... shopkeeper instance432 hand instance423 "
```

No `item<n>` property of any kind. The same run at frame 47 reports the same
list. And in `captures/arena-shop-3/…` at shop frame **87** — seven frames past
the `hacking2` page — the enumeration reads
`… item35 item33 item32 item31 item30 item40 …`: **exactly the six ids the
static instance table gives for frame 80**, and no others. The display list is
reset by the `gotoAndPlay`, so previous pages' items are gone.

**Conclusion:** the handlers are wired for *a page at a time*, and a navigator
must send the shop clip to a category page before any `item<n>.onRelease` exists.
The wrapper already does this (`shop.gotoAndPlay(page)`), and the logs show the
page walk working.

### 1.4 The second half of the stall: `onRelease` alone is not enough

`buyweapon` does **not** read the item that was clicked. It reads three
timeline variables on the weaponsmith clip — `itemnumber`, `itemtype`,
`itemcost` — and **only `getweaponinfo` ever sets them**:

```text
getweaponinfo(whichweapon)                     // r1 = _root, r2 = whichweapon
  itemnumber = whichweapon._name.charAt(4)
             + whichweapon._name.charAt(5)                    // +0x09ac
  itemnumber = Number(itemnumber)                             // +0x09e0
  itemtype   = _root["weapon" + itemnumber][0]                // +0x09ea
  itemtype   = _root.weapontypes[itemtype]                    // +0x0a06
  itemweight = _root["weapon" + itemnumber][2]                // +0x0a18
  itemweight = _root.weaponweights[itemweight]                // +0x0a30
  itemcost   = Math.round(_root["weapon"+itemnumber][0] * 2
                        + _root["weapon"+itemnumber][3] * 9
                        + _root["weapon"+itemnumber][4] * 45 * 3.1)   // +0x0a42
  if (itemtype == "ranged") itemcost = Math.round(itemcost / 2)       // +0x0ad5
  ...
```

`getweaponinfo` is wired **only as `onRollOver`** (`weaponbuttons` `+0x089b`,
body `+0x08ab` calls `getweaponinfo(this)`). A human hovers before clicking; a
script that calls `onRelease()` directly never does.

`weaponbuttons` itself contains one stray `itemnumber = Number(weap_i)` at
`+0x07f6`, on the common path of the `i = 1..80` loop — so after the loop
finishes, `itemnumber` holds `weap_i` for `i = 80`, which is **20**.

That prediction is confirmed to the digit by
`captures/arena-shop-5/arena-shop-5-obs-a1.rufflelog`:

```text
"step":"shop-operands-unreadable", ... "itemcost":"NaN","itemnumber":"20",
"goldpieces":"5000000","shopFrame":154
```

`itemnumber` is exactly 20; `itemcost` is `NaN` because `buyweapon` computes
`char_discount = itemcost * charisma / 200` (`+0x0fd5`) from an `itemcost`
nobody initialised, then subtracts it (`+0x1026`).

And in `captures/arena-shop-4/…` the confirm did fire:

```text
"step":"shop-bought", ... "item":39,"cost":null,"weapon":20,"goldLeft":4000
```

Item **39** was pressed; `hero.weapon` became **20**; and 5 000 000 staged gold
became 4 000, because `goldpieces -= NaN` produced `NaN` and `check_for_nan`
repaired it to `herolevel * 1000`.

**Unverified:** whether calling `item<n>.onRollOver()` immediately before
`item<n>.onRelease()` is behaviourally identical to a real hover-then-click.
Nothing in either handler reads mouse state, so it should be, but it has not
been run.

---

## 2. The weapon data table

### 2.1 Where it lives and how it is shaped

All of it is built as plain root variables in one run of literals at
`root/frame:35/DoAction@0x3fa9dc`, `+0x3c46` … `+0x4c9c`. Each entry is:

```text
Push "weapon<N>", a, b, c, d, <name>, e, 6, "Array" ; NewObject ; SetVariable
```

`NewObject` pops the class name, then the argument count, then the arguments
from the top of the stack, so the compiler pushes them in reverse. The resulting
array is therefore `[e, name, d, c, b, a]`:

| index | meaning | read by |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `[0]` | type index into `weapontypes` | `battlevalues` `+0x3122`, `getweaponinfo` `+0x09ea` |
| `[1]` | display name (string literal; not reproduced here) | `battlevalues` `+0x3142`, `buyweapon` `+0x0cf2` |
| `[2]` | weight index into `weaponweights`; also `attack_speed` | `battlevalues` `+0x3174` and `+0x346a` |
| `[3]` | **min damage** | `battlevalues` `+0x31be` |
| `[4]` | **max damage** | `battlevalues` `+0x31da` |
| `[5]` | range multiplier (`weapon_range = physical_size + [5]*44`) | `battlevalues` `+0x3190` |

Supporting arrays, same block:

```text
armourweights    = ["", ?, ?, ?]                     // +0x3c46  (4 entries)
armourtypes      = ["", "boot", "shinguard", "greaves", "breastplate",
                    "gauntlet", "shoulderguard", "helmet", "shield"]  // +0x3c76
armoursets       = ["", "", <25 set names>]          // +0x3c96  (27 entries)
armoursetweights = [1,1,1,2,3,1,2,2,3,1,1,2,2,3,1,2,3,2,3,1,3,2,2,3,1,2,3]
                                                     // +0x3cda  (27 entries)
weapontypes      = ["", "slashing", "bashing", "hacking", "ranged"]   // +0x3d8c
weaponenchantments_potency (4)                       // +0x3da4
weaponenchantments (6)                               // +0x3dba
weaponweights (6)                                    // +0x3dd4
```

Weight index 1 is the heaviest and 5 the lightest (the string literals run
"Very heavy" → "Very light", pushed in that order at `+0x3dd4`).

► **THIS SENTENCE IS NOW MACHINE-CHECKED, AND IT SPENT TWELVE DAYS BEING
  IGNORED BY THE FILE THAT NEEDED IT.** `MAP_SILENCE.swing-cost` in
  `src/adapter/vanilla-fields.js` declared that the array's *"VALUES this
  repository does not hold"*, cited `:345` — two lines above this one — for the
  LOCATION, and the engine's `ss2WeaponMass` therefore carried its direction as
  AUTHORED, inferred from a damage correlation. It was ranked as the cheapest
  open question on the board and put to the owner as work. Read off the
  installed build on 2026-09-11 the sentence is exactly right, and the
  inference was right with it.
  **Two things worth keeping from it.** `weaponweights` holds STRINGS, so
  `attack_speed` is a weight-CLASS index and never a numeric speed — the field
  name misleads. And `tools/item-table-transcription.mjs` now verifies the
  shape, the direction and the push-order convention on every run, the last
  against `weapontypes`, whose reversed form §2.2 cross-checks from the ninety
  rows' own `[0]` values. **It reproduces no entry**: the direction is tested by
  substring, per the licensing boundary in §2.1.
  What is still genuinely unrecorded is narrower: the map names no READER for
  `attack_speed` anywhere, so what the build DOES with the weight class remains
  unknown.

`physical_size = 80 + Math.round(strength / 1.5)` (`battlevalues` `+0x30f1`),
which is why `weapon_range` moves with strength as well as with `[5]`.

### 2.2 The band → category mapping is CONFIRMED, not assumed

The route map's `1–20 slashing / 21–40 hacking / 41–60 bashing / 61–80 ranged`
is **correct**, and it is now verified from two independent places rather than
inferred:

- Every id 1–20 has `[0] = 1`; 21–40 have `[0] = 3`; 41–60 have `[0] = 2`;
  61–80 have `[0] = 4`. Zero exceptions across all 80 literals.
- `weapontypes[1] = "slashing"`, `[2] = "bashing"`, `[3] = "hacking"`,
  `[4] = "ranged"` (`+0x3d8c`).
- The frame labels agree: the ids on `bashing1..3` all have `[0] = 2`, the ids
  on `hacking1..3` all have `[0] = 3`, and so on.

Note the *timeline* order of the pages (bashing 48/56/64, hacking 72/80/88,
slashing 96/106/116, ranged 124/131/139) is **not** the id order. That is a
layout fact, not a data fact.

### 2.3 The full shop table (ids 1–80)

`weap_i` is the position within the band; `itemlevel = weap_i * 3`; the gate is
`itemlevel <= <attribute>` where the attribute is `speed` for slashing and
ranged, `strength` for hacking and bashing (§3.1). `shop itemcost` is the
undiscounted quote `getweaponinfo` computes at `+0x0a42` (halved for ranged at
`+0x0ad5`); §4 gives the discounts.

### 2.4 Ids that exist in the table but are not in the weapon shop

`weapon0` is the starting weapon written by the `heroDNA` literal (index 13 is
`0`, so a fresh gladiator's `hero.weapon` is 0 and `_root.weapon0` is what
`battlevalues` resolves). Ids 201–220 are reachable only through paths this
document does not map (the magic shop's `enchant_weapon`, `unleash_hell`'s
hard-coded champion DNA, and `randomise_gladiator`).

| id | `[0]` type | `[2]` wt | `[3]` min | `[4]` max | `[5]` rng | literal at |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 3 | 1 | `+0x3dee` |
| 201 | 1 | 4 | 5 | 19 | 2 | `+0x4b44` |
| 202 | 1 | 3 | 10 | 30 | 2 | `+0x4b6f` |
| 203 | 2 | 4 | 20 | 80 | 2 | `+0x4b9a` |
| 204 | 3 | 3 | 25 | 100 | 2 | `+0x4bc5` |
| 205 | 3 | 3 | 25 | 100 | 3 | `+0x4bf0` |
| 206 | 1 | 3 | 30 | 110 | 3 | `+0x4c1b` |
| 207 | 1 | 3 | 40 | 150 | 3 | `+0x4c46` |
| 210 | 1 | 3 | 30 | 300 | 3 | `+0x4c71` |
| 220 | 1 | 3 | 200 | 800 | 4 | `+0x4c9c` |

Id **220** is the outlier: `[3]/[4]` = 200 / 800, higher than anything in the
shop. Nothing in the purchase path can reach it. **Not mapped:** which site,
if any, awards it.

## 3. The gates, precisely

### 3.1 The weapon gate — what is really compared

The route map recorded `item.itemlevel <= item.attribute_required`, and noted
it reads oddly. It reads oddly because **the field name lies**:
`attribute_required` does not hold a requirement, it holds a **snapshot of the
hero's own governing attribute**, taken when `weaponbuttons()` ran.

`weaponbuttons()` — `sprite:1961/frame:1/DoAction@0x6110ce` `+0x0571`, body
from `+0x0589`; register 1 is `this` (the weaponsmith clip), register 2 is
`_root`:

```text
weaponbuttons() {
  _root.delete_tooltips();                                       // +0x0589
  i = 1;                                                         // +0x059b
  while (!(i > 80)) {                     // +0x05a6 .. +0x05b7 / back +0x0982
    weap_i = i;                                                  // +0x05bc
    if      (!(i > 20)) { attr = _root.game.hero.speed;    txt = "Agility";  }
                                                    // +0x05c5 .. +0x0611
    else if (!(i > 40)) { weap_i = i - 20;
                          attr = _root.game.hero.strength; txt = "Strength"; }
                                                    // +0x065d .. +0x06a5
    else if (!(i > 60)) { weap_i = i - 40;
                          attr = _root.game.hero.strength; txt = "Strength"; }
                                                    // +0x06f6 .. +0x073e
    else if (!(i > 80)) { weap_i = i - 60;
                          attr = _root.game.hero.speed;    txt = "Agility";  }
                                                    // +0x078f .. +0x07d7
    this["item"+i].attribute_required     = attr;
    this["item"+i].attribute_required_txt = txt;
    this["item"+i].itemlevel              = weap_i * 3;
                          // +0x061e / +0x06b2 / +0x074b / +0x07e4, all "* 3"
    itemnumber = Number(weap_i);                                 // +0x07f6
    ...
  }
}
```

So for item id `N` with band position `p`:

```text
item.itemlevel          = 3 * p
item.attribute_required = hero.speed     (ids 1..20 slashing, 61..80 ranged)
                        | hero.strength  (ids 21..40 hacking, 41..60 bashing)
```

and the `onRelease` gate at `+0x0929` is:

```text
Push this.itemlevel            // +0x0929
Push this.attribute_required   // +0x0931
Greater                        // +0x0939   -> (itemlevel > attribute_required)
Not ; Not ; If -> refusal      // +0x093a .. +0x093c
buyweapon(this)                // +0x0941
```

`ActionGreater` yields `first-pushed > second-pushed`; the operand order is
fixed independently by the armour comparison at `armourbuttons` `+0x0aa6`,
whose semantics are pinned by which arm greys the item out. The real gate is
therefore:

> **`3 * band_position <= hero.speed`** for slashing and ranged,
> **`3 * band_position <= hero.strength`** for hacking and bashing.

The same expression, with the operands pushed in the other order and the
`Less2` opcode, controls the greyed-out rendering at `+0x0812`–`+0x0826`
(`attribute_required < itemlevel` → `_alpha = 90`, `blendMode = "invert"`).

**Weapon slots are attribute-gated and not level-gated at all.** The route map
already said this; it is now confirmed — `herolevel` appears nowhere in
`weaponbuttons` or in the `onRelease` body.

Two structural notes that matter to a navigator:

- The `onRollOver` and `onRelease` assignments (`+0x089b`, `+0x08c6`) are
  **outside** the greying `if` — the `If` at `+0x085f` jumps to `+0x088f`,
  the first instruction after the grey-out block. A greyed item still has a
  live handler; it just takes the refusal arm.
- The refusal arm (`+0x0954`) only sets `bubbletext` to a `<refusal text>`
  naming the required attribute and value. It does **not** move the playhead.
  So a refused click is silent and idempotent, and the only way to tell refusal
  from acceptance is that the clip did *not* reach `getitem` (frame 147).

### 3.2 The armour gate

`armourbuttons()` — `sprite:1909/frame:1/DoAction@0x5f1fa9` `+0x0786`, body
from `+0x079e`; register 1 is `this`, register 2 is `_root`, register 3 is
`_global`:

```text
armourbuttons() {
  _root.delete_tooltips();                                       // +0x079e
  i = 1;
  while (!(i > 60)) {                     // +0x07bb .. / back +0x0bfc
    itemnumber = Number(this["item"+i]._name.charAt(4)
                      + this["item"+i]._name.charAt(5));         // +0x07d1
    if      (!(itemnumber >  4)) this["item"+i].itemlevel =  1;   // +0x0823
    else if (!(itemnumber >  6)) this["item"+i].itemlevel =  6;   // +0x0855
    else if (!(itemnumber >  9)) this["item"+i].itemlevel = 12;   // +0x089e
    else if (!(itemnumber > 12)) this["item"+i].itemlevel = 18;   // +0x08e7
    else if (!(itemnumber > 15)) this["item"+i].itemlevel = 24;   // +0x0930
    else if (!(itemnumber > 18)) this["item"+i].itemlevel = 30;   // +0x0979
    else if (!(itemnumber > 21)) this["item"+i].itemlevel = 36;   // +0x09c2
    else if (!(itemnumber > 24)) this["item"+i].itemlevel = 42;   // +0x0a0b
    else if   (itemnumber > 24)  this["item"+i].itemlevel = 48;   // +0x0a54
    if (_root.game.hero.herolevel < this["item"+i].itemlevel) {   // +0x0a80
      this["item"+i]._alpha = 90; this["item"+i].blendMode = "invert";
    }
    this["item"+i].onRollOver = function () {
      getarmourinfo(this, armourpiece);                          // +0x0ae4
    };
    this["item"+i].onRelease = function () {                     // +0x0b15
      _root.clicksound.start();                                  // +0x0b25
      if (this.itemlevel > 12 && _global.game_mode == "demo") {  // +0x0b3d
        bubbletext = <refusal text>;
      } else if (!(this.itemlevel > _root.game.hero.herolevel)) {// +0x0b77
        buyarmour(this, armourpiece, this.itemlevel);            // +0x0ba9
      } else if (_global.game_mode == "full") {                  // +0x0bbc
        bubbletext = <refusal text naming this.itemlevel>;
      } else {
        bubbletext = <refusal text>;
      }
    };
    i++;
  }
}
```

The route map's `item.itemlevel <= _root.game.hero.herolevel` at `+0x0b77` is
**exactly right** — the armour gate really does compare the item to the hero.
It is only the *weapon* gate that was mis-transcribed, and only because the
weapon field is misnamed in the game's own source.

`armourpiece` is a plain timeline variable set by the page frame itself, before
it calls `armourbuttons`; the value is the index into `armourtypes`:

| `armourpiece` | piece | page frames | item numbers on each |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `boot` | 79, 86 | 2–13 / 14–25 |
| 2 | `shinguard` | 105, 111 | 2–14 / 15–25 |
| 3 | `greaves` | 131, 138 | 2–14 / 15–25 |
| 4 | `breastplate` | 48, 56, 64, 71 | 2–10 / 11–16 / 17–22 / 23–25 |
| 5 | `gauntlet` | 93, 99 | 2–15 / 16–25 |
| 6 | `shoulderguard` | 117, 124 | 2–14 / 15–25 |
| 7 | `helmet` | 146, 152, 158 | 2–10 / 11–19 / 20–25 |
| 8 | `shield` | 164, 171, 177 | 2–11 / 12, 14–19 / 20–25 |

Each `armourpiece` assignment is at `+0x0000` of that frame's `DoAction`, and
`armourbuttons()` is called at `+0x0016` of the same block.

**`shield` item 13 is placed on no page** and so, like weapon ids 59 and 61, can
never be bought. Every other piece carries the full 2–25 range.

Item number **1** is on no page either, in any piece — it is the "no armour"
entry, `armoursets[1]`, matching the `heroDNA` literal's zeros at the armour
indices.

### 3.3 The two "full game" refusals — which branch actually applies

Both shops carry a lock, and **they test two different flags**.

**Armour** (`armourbuttons` `+0x0b3d`, and the tooltip copy at `getarmourinfo`
`+0x0d1a`):

```text
if (item.itemlevel > 12 && _global.game_mode == "demo") { <demo refusal> }
```

**Weapons** (`weaponbuttons` `onRelease` `+0x08ee`, and the grey-out at
`+0x083e`):

```text
if (item.itemlevel > 16 && _root.fizMode != "fizzle") { <demo refusal> }
```

Note the weapon test is `!=`, not `==`: `Equals2` at `+0x0914` followed by `Not`
at `+0x0915`, with the `&&` join at `+0x0916`.

Both are inert in this build, and the chain that settles it is short:

1. `root/frame:1/DoAction@0x5b66c` `+0x0026`: `_root.fizMode = "fizzle"`,
   unconditionally, on the movie's very first frame.
2. `root/frame:10/DoAction@0x3c46b8` `+0x00ea`:
   `if (_root.fizMode == "fizzle") _global.game_mode = "full";`
   `else _global.game_mode = "demo";` (`+0x0102` / `+0x0115`).

So `fizMode == "fizzle"` → the weapon lock's second operand is false → **no
weapon is demo-locked**; and `game_mode == "full"` → **no armour is
demo-locked**. This agrees with the handoff's live reading of `game_mode`, and
it also explains it: `game_mode` is *derived* from `fizMode`, and `fizMode` is
set by a literal in frame 1 that nothing else writes.

**The earlier audit's "this is the demo build" inference is wrong in both
shops.** Neither `itemlevel > 12` nor `itemlevel > 16` refuses anything at
runtime. The only live gates are the attribute gate (weapons), the herolevel
gate (armour), and gold.

### 3.4 Every way a purchase can be refused

| # | Refusal | Site | Live? |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The id has no clip on the current page | the `weaponbuttons` / `armourbuttons` loop is a silent no-op on `undefined` | **yes** — weapon ids 59 and 61, shield item 13, and every id not on the page currently loaded |
| 2 | `3*weap_i > hero.speed` / `hero.strength` | `+0x0929` | **yes** |
| 3 | `item.itemlevel > 16 && fizMode != "fizzle"` | `+0x08ee` | no — `fizMode` is `"fizzle"` |
| 4 | `item.itemlevel > hero.herolevel` (armour) | `+0x0b77` | **yes** |
| 5 | `item.itemlevel > 12 && game_mode == "demo"` | `+0x0b3d` | no — `game_mode` is `"full"` |
| 6 | Already wielding / wearing this exact item | `buyweapon` `+0x1075`, `buyarmour` `+0x13cf` | **yes** — the quote page is still shown, with all costs forced to 0 |
| 7 | `goldpieces < itemcost` | confirm buttons 1952 `+0x015d`, 1907 `+0x010f` | **yes** |

Only #1, #2 and #4 refuse *before* the shop plays `getitem`; #6 and #7 refuse on
the confirm page. That is what makes "did the clip reach frame 147 / 184?" a
valid read of gates 1–5 — the test the wrapper already uses.

---

## 4. Cost

### 4.1 The weapon quote

Computed by `getweaponinfo` on **rollover**, then mutated in place by
`buyweapon`. Let `W = _root["weapon" + itemnumber]`.

```text
// getweaponinfo, +0x0a42 .. +0x0ac2
itemcost = Math.round( W[0]*2 + W[3]*9 + W[4]*45*3.1 )
// +0x0ad5 .. +0x0af7
if (itemtype == "ranged") itemcost = Math.round(itemcost / 2)
```

`W[0]` is the type index 1..4, so it contributes 2–8 gold; the price is driven
almost entirely by `W[4] * 139.5`.

### 4.2 The trade-in

`buyweapon(whichweapon)` — `sprite:1961/frame:1/DoAction@0x6110ce`,
`DefineFunction2` at `+0x0bf6`, body from `+0x0c17`; register 1 is `_root`.
Its first two acts are `goldpieces = _root.game.hero.goldpieces` (`+0x0c17`)
and `gotoAndPlay("getitem"); Play` (`+0x0c2e`).

The branch at `+0x0d51`–`+0x0dc6`:

```text
if ((hero.weapon != 0 && itemtype != "ranged")
 || (hero.secondary_weapon != 0 && itemtype == "ranged"))   -> trade-in branch
else                                                        -> no-trade branch
```

Trade-in branch, with `O` the *old* weapon's array — `weapon[hero.weapon]` for a
melee purchase (`+0x0dde`), `weapon[hero.secondary_weapon]` for a ranged one
(`+0x0ec2`):

```text
olditemcost = Math.ceil( O[0]*2 + O[3]*9 + O[4]*45*2 )     // *2 here, not *3.1
if (itemtype == "ranged") olditemcost = Math.round(olditemcost / 2)   // +0x0f69
trade_discount = Math.round(olditemcost / 4)                          // +0x0fb2
char_discount  = Math.round(itemcost * hero.charisma / 200)           // +0x0fd5
itemcostbefore = itemcost                                             // +0x100d
itemcost       = itemcost - trade_discount                            // +0x1016
itemcost       = itemcost - char_discount                             // +0x1026
if (itemcost < 1) itemcost = 1                                        // +0x1036
```

No-trade branch (`+0x1172` onward) is the same without the trade term:

```text
char_discount  = Math.round(itemcost * hero.charisma / 200)           // +0x11d6
itemcostbefore = itemcost                                             // +0x120e
itemcost       = itemcost - char_discount                             // +0x1217
if (itemcost < 1) itemcost = 1                                        // +0x1227
```

`trade_discount` is **not** reset in that branch; only the display string is set
to a "nothing to trade in" literal (`+0x1273`).

The "already own it" arm at `+0x1075`–`+0x1116` forces
`char_discount = trade_discount = itemcostbefore = itemcost = 0` and shows a
refusal — so an operator who re-offers the same id gets a **zero-cost quote**
that button 1952 will still confirm (the gold check passes and `hero.weapon` is
re-set to the same value). Harmless, but not a no-op.

### 4.3 The full weapon cost formula

```text
base     = round( W[0]*2 + W[3]*9 + W[4]*45*3.1 )
base     = round(base / 2)                              if W is ranged
old      = ceil( O[0]*2 + O[3]*9 + O[4]*45*2 )          O = the slot being traded
old      = round(old / 2)                               if the purchase is ranged
trade    = round(old / 4)                               0 when that slot is empty
charisma = round(base * hero.charisma / 200)
itemcost = max(1, base - trade - charisma)
```

For id 20 with an empty weapon slot and charisma 1: `base = 94538`,
`char_discount = round(94538 * 1 / 200) = 473`, `itemcost = 94065`.

### 4.4 What the confirm button does

Weapon confirm, `root/button:1952/condition:0`:

```text
if (_root.game.hero.goldpieces < itemcost) { <refusal text> }        // +0x0145
else {
  if (itemcost != 0) _root.coins.start();                            // +0x0193
  if (itemtype != "ranged") {
    _root.game.hero.weapon = itemnumber;                             // +0x01ee
    _root.game.hero.weapon_enchantment_potency = 1;
    _root.game.hero.weapon_enchantment_type    = 1;
  } else {
    _root.game.hero.secondary_weapon = itemnumber;
    _root.game.hero.secondary_weapon_enchantment_potency = 1;        // +0x0275
    _root.game.hero.secondary_weapon_enchantment_type    = 1;        // +0x0292
  }
  _root.game.hero.goldpieces -= itemcost;                            // +0x02af
  _root.constructDNA();                                              // +0x02d1
  itempurchased = "yes";                                             // +0x02e7
  gotoAndPlay("browse");                                             // +0x02ef
}
```

Armour confirm, `root/button:1907/condition:0`, is the same shape with an
eight-way dispatch on `armourpiece` writing `_root.game.hero.<piece> =
itemnumber` (`+0x0232` breastplate, `+0x0262` gauntlet, `+0x0292`
shoulderguard, `+0x02c2` helmet, `+0x02f2` shield, and the boot / shinguard /
greaves arms above them), then `goldpieces -= itemcost` (`+0x030d`),
`constructDNA()` (`+0x033e`), `itempurchased = "yes"` (`+0x0345`) and
`gotoAndPlay("buy")` (`+0x034d`). The armoury returns to `buy` (frame 37); the
weaponsmith returns to `browse` (frame 26).

Both read `itemcost`, `itemnumber` and `itemtype` as bare `GetVariable`, which
in a button placed inside the shop sprite resolves against that sprite's own
timeline. That is why the wrapper's `clip.itemcost` / `clip.itemnumber` reads
address the right object — the values simply were never written.

**Buying a ranged item never changes `min_damage`.** It writes
`secondary_weapon`, and `battlevalues` only copies the secondary pair over the
primary pair when `using_bow` is true (`+0x3416`–`+0x344a`), which root frame
221 clears at battle construction.

---

## 5. The armour table

### 5.1 Shape

There is no per-item armour array. An armour item is fully described by two
numbers — the **piece** (1..8) and the **item number** (1..26) — plus eight
`_global` scalars:

```text
// battlevalues, +0x3089 .. +0x30e4  (register 2 = _global)
breastplate_dval   = 16      helmet_dval   = 10
shinguard_dval     =  6      greaves_dval  =  3
shoulderguard_dval =  8      gauntlet_dval =  5
boot_dval          =  2      shield_dval   = 12
```

Shop side, `checkarmour(armourpiece, itemnumber)`
(`sprite:1909/frame:1/DoAction@0x5f1fa9`, body from `+0x0e46`; register 1 is
`_root`, register 2 is `_global`, register 3 is `itemnumber`, register 4 is
`armourpiece`):

```text
dval            = _global[<piece>_dval]              // +0x0e57 .. +0x10b1
olditem         = _root.game.hero[<piece>]
itemdefence     = Math.ceil(itemnumber * dval)                      // +0x110b
old_itemdefence = Math.ceil(olditem    * dval)                      // +0x1128
old_itemcost    = Math.round(old_itemdefence * old_itemdefence * 3) // +0x1149
trade_discount  = Math.ceil(old_itemcost * (100 - hero.charisma) / 200 / 4)
                                                                    // +0x1173
```

and in `getarmourinfo(whicharmour, armourpiece)` (body from `+0x0c33`; register
1 is `_root`, register 2 is `_global`, register 3 is `whicharmour`, register 4
is `armourpiece`):

```text
itemnumber = Number(whicharmour._name.charAt(4)
                  + whicharmour._name.charAt(5))                    // +0x0c33
itemset    = _root.armoursets[itemnumber]                           // +0x0c71
itemtype   = _root.armourtypes[armourpiece]                         // +0x0c83
itemweight = _root.armourweights[_root.armoursetweights[itemnumber]]
                                                       // +0x0caa, +0x0cbc
checkarmour(armourpiece, itemnumber)                                // +0x0cce
itemcost   = Math.round(itemdefence * itemdefence * 3)              // +0x0ce2
```

Each item number is one **set**, applied across all eight pieces, so
`armoursets` and `armoursetweights` are indexed by item number, not by piece.
`armoursetweights` (`+0x3cda`, 27 entries, index 0 first) is

```text
[1,1,1,2,3,1,2,2,3,1,1,2,2,3,1,2,3,2,3,1,3,2,2,3,1,2,3]
```

into `armourweights` (`+0x3c46`, 4 entries) — 1 lightest, 3 heaviest.

Item number **26** exists in `armoursets` but is on no shop page. It is the one
value the helmet special case is for (§5.4).

### 5.2 Cost formula, armour

```text
itemdefence = ceil(n * dval)                    // n = item number
base        = round(itemdefence^2 * 3)
old_def     = ceil(hero[<piece>] * dval)
old_cost    = round(old_def^2 * 3)
trade       = ceil(old_cost * (100 - hero.charisma) / 800)
charisma    = round(base * hero.charisma / 200)
itemcost    = max(1, base - charisma - trade)
              // buyarmour trade arm    +0x1357 .. +0x13c4
              // buyarmour no-trade arm +0x1484 .. +0x14ea
```

The trade term uses `(100 - charisma)`, not `charisma` — **higher charisma gives
a smaller trade-in credit** in the armoury while giving a larger straight
discount. The subtraction is at `+0x117b`–`+0x1195`. It looks like an authoring
slip rather than a design; it is recorded here without judgement, because the
navigator only needs the number.

`buyarmour(whicharmour, armourpiece, itemlevel)` opens the same way as
`buyweapon`: `goldpieces = hero.goldpieces` (`+0x11f3`), then
`gotoAndPlay("getitem"); Play` (`+0x120a`). It too reads `itemcost`,
`itemdefence`, `itemtype`, `itemnumber`, `itemweight`, `olditem` and
`trade_discount` off the timeline — all of which only `getarmourinfo` and
`checkarmour` write, and only from `onRollOver` (`+0x0ae4`). **The armoury has
exactly the same rollover dependency as the weapon shop.**

### 5.3 Defence and cost per set and piece

Cells are `itemdefence / base cost`; the number after each piece name is its
`dval`. `armourclass` is the plain sum of the eight `<piece>_defence` values
(`battlevalues` `+0x3ac3`, copied to `armourclass` at `+0x3b0f`).

| set `n` | `itemlevel` | wt | boot (2) | shin (6) | greav (3) | breast (16) | gaunt (5) | shldr (8) | helm (10) | shield (12) | full `armourclass` | full base cost |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

The sets are strictly linear in `n`. The `dval`s sum to 62 and their squares sum
to 638, so `full armourclass = 62n` and `full base cost = 3 * 638 * n^2 =
1914 n^2` (checks: `n = 2` → 124 / 7 656; `n = 25` → 1550 / 1 196 250).

### 5.4 What the battle side does with it

```text
<piece>_defence = Math.round(hero.<piece> * <piece>_dval)   // +0x3480 .. +0x35e1
armourclass_max = breastplate_defence + helmet_defence + shinguard_defence
                + greaves_defence + shoulderguard_defence + gauntlet_defence
                + boot_defence + shield_defence                    // +0x3ac3
armourclass     = armourclass_max                                  // +0x3b0f
```

`round` in battle versus `ceil` in the shop is the same value for integer item
numbers, so the shop's displayed defence is the battle's defence.

Two special cases:

- **Helmet above 25.** `if (hero.helmet > 25) helmet_defence =
  round(herolevel * 0.5 * helmet_dval)` (`+0x34a7`–`+0x351e`). Item number 26 is
  the only value that trips it, and it is on no shop page — so this branch is
  unreachable from a purchase.
- **Shield with a bow.** `shield_defence` is computed only when
  `using_bow != true`; otherwise it is set to **0** (`+0x35e2`, `+0x3623`).
  Swapping to the secondary weapon costs the hero its entire shield
  contribution to `armourclass`.

`checkarmour` also composes the per-piece flavour bonus the shop displays —
boot `itemnumber*2` movement, shinguard `itemnumber*2` jump, greaves
`itemnumber*1` crit protection, breastplate `itemnumber*1` damage-to-energy,
gauntlet `itemnumber*2` shove, shoulderguard `itemnumber*2` charge, helmet
`itemnumber*1.5` crit protection, shield `itemnumber*1.5` missile deflection
(`+0x0e79`, `+0x0ed1`, `+0x0f29`, `+0x0f78`, `+0x0fc7`, `+0x101f`, `+0x1077`,
`+0x10d3`). **Unverified:** whether any of these is read by a battle site.
Nothing in `battlevalues` reads them.

---

## 6. Base attributes, and why the gate bites

`global_DNA_settings` (`root/frame:35/DoAction@0x3ffdcf`) sets a `heroDNA`
literal of 51 comma-separated fields at `+0x0766`. `initcharacter`
(`root/frame:35/DoAction@0x40bf76`) maps `characterDNA[i]` onto the character
field by field; the indices that matter here:

| index | field | `heroDNA` value |
| ---: | --- | ---: |
| 13 | `weapon` | 0 |
| 16 | `strength` | 1 |
| 17 | `speed` | 1 |
| 18 | `attack` | 1 |
| 19 | `defence` | 1 |
| 20 | `vitality` | 1 |
| 21 | `charisma` | 1 |
| 24 | `herolevel` | 1 |
| 26 | `experienceneeded` | **125** |
| 29 | `goldpieces` | 2500 |
| 45 | `secondary_weapon` | 0 |
| 48 | `maximum_ammo` | 5 |
| 49 | `equipped_weapon` | 1 |

`initwarrior` (`root/frame:35/DoAction@0x3ffdcf`) then grants
`statpoints = 9` for a brand-new gladiator (`+0x0b41`), and `0` when an existing
`charDNA` is being restored (`+0x0b1f`).

Index 26 independently confirms the handoff's correction that level 1 needs
**125** experience, not 60.

So the floor is `strength = speed = 1`, and 9 creation points plus per-level
points are the only unstaged way up before the shop. Nine points all into one
attribute reaches 10, which unlocks `weap_i <= 3` — ids 1–3, 21–23, 41–43,
62–63. That is the realistic unstaged ceiling at herolevel 4–5, and it is why
the recommendation in §0.2 is conditional on staging.

## 7. Data anomalies found while reading the tables

Recorded because a navigator that "picks the best item" will otherwise pick one
of them.

1. **Id 57 has `[3] > [4]`** — min 100, max 30 (`+0x473c`). Every other entry in
   the build satisfies `[3] <= [4]`. Its computed shop cost collapses to 5 089,
   an order of magnitude below its neighbours (56 costs 38 479, 58 costs
   51 304), because cost is dominated by `[4]`. A "highest max damage" scan
   skips it; a "cheapest above a damage threshold" scan would grab it.
2. **Weapon ids 59 and 61, and shield item 13, are on no page** and cannot be
   bought by any route through these shops.
3. **Ranged `[5]` is 100 for eighteen of the twenty ids, but 4 for ids 65 and
   75** (`+0x4894`, `+0x4a42`). Since `weapon_range = physical_size + [5]*44`,
   those two get `physical_size + 176` where their neighbours get
   `physical_size + 4400` — bows with melee reach. Almost certainly an authoring
   slip; recorded, not corrected.
4. **Melee `[4]` is `[3]` squared** across the whole slashing band (3→9, 4→16,
   … 26→676) and the whole ranged band. ~~Hacking and bashing use `[4] = 4*[3]`
   up to ids 34 and 56 and then diverge.~~ ► **CORRECTED 2026-09-07: the
   hacking half is right, the bashing half is wrong in kind, not in degree.**
   **Hacking** uses `[4] = 4*[3]` for ids 21–34 and diverges from id 35 onward
   (35 is 70/240 = 3.43, falling to 2.59 by id 40) — as stated. **Bashing never
   uses 4× at all.** It uses `[4] = 3*[3]` for every id in 41–60 with exactly
   two exceptions: id **55** (80/250, ratio 3.125) and id **57** (100/30, the
   §7.1 anomaly). Re-derive by importing `src/team/ss2-weapon-table.js` and
   dividing `maxDamage` by `minDamage` across each band. Still useful as an
   independent cross-check that the six-element array decode is the right way
   round — with 3×, not 4×, as bashing's expected ratio.
5. **`weapon0`'s type index is 2 (bashing)**, which does not match what the
   starting weapon is called. Inert — nothing gates on the starter's type.

## 8. Everything not settled

| Claim | Status | What would settle it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `item.onRollOver()` immediately before `item.onRelease()` behaves like a real hover-then-click | ~~**unverified** — neither handler reads mouse state, but it has not been run~~ ► **VERIFIED 2026-09-07 — it HAS been run, and it worked.** Capture `arena-shop-6` logs `{"step":"shop-bought","kind":"weapon","item":39,"cost":56870,"weapon":39,"goldLeft":843130}`: item 39 was requested, `hero.weapon` became **39** rather than the stuck 20, and `cost` read back as a number rather than `NaN`. The run predates this document's own first commit | *(settled — the settling run is in the archive)* |
| `armourbuttons` leaves its `itemnumber` as `NaN` after the loop (no clip exists for `i = 60`) | **inferred** from the loop shape. `buyarmour` gets the item as an argument, but still reads `itemnumber` at `+0x123b` to attach the display clip | the same run, logging `armoursmith.itemnumber` after a page load |
| `whichweapon` — the character property `battlevalues` reads `attack_type` and `attack_speed` from at `+0x3450` / `+0x346a` | **not mapped** — it is assigned outside `battlevalues` | a whole-build reference sweep on `whichweapon` |
| The per-piece armour flavour bonuses are read by any battle site | **unverified** — nothing in `battlevalues` reads them | a reference sweep on each bonus's field name |
| Which site, if any, awards weapon ids 201–220 | **not mapped** | out of scope here; `enchant_weapon` and `unleash_hell` are the candidates |
| The `browse`-page category buttons a human uses to reach `slashing1` etc. | **not decoded** — unnamed `DefineButton2` placements | not needed: `gotoAndPlay(<label>)` is observed working in four capture sessions |
| `angry` (frame 27) is played by the leave button when `itempurchased == null` | **inferred** — the pattern is visible at `root/button:1984/condition:0` `+0x0046`, and buttons 1849, 1929 and 2033 carry the identical three-reference shape | reading each shop's own leave button |
| A second `buyweapon` without an intervening `getweaponinfo` double-discounts | **inferred** from `itemcost` being mutated in place at `+0x1016` / `+0x1026` rather than recomputed | a run that calls `onRelease` twice on one id and logs `clip.itemcost` between them |
| Whether display-list state from an earlier page survives a straight forward play (rather than a `gotoAndPlay`) into the next page | **unverified**, and irrelevant to the navigator, which always jumps | a run that lets the shop play 48 → 56 without a jump |

---

## 9. Changes this track would make elsewhere (not made — other tracks own these files)

1. ~~**`tools/runtime-capture/ss2-capture-wrapper.as`, `shop-open`.** It must
   call `shop["item" + shopItem].onRollOver()` before `.onRelease()`.~~
   ► **MADE, and made before this list was written — struck 2026-09-07.** The
   call is in the file today: `chosen.onRollOver();` at
   `ss2-capture-wrapper.as:1200`, immediately followed by `chosen.onRelease();`
   at :1201, behind a both-handlers-bound guard at :1193 that logs
   `shop-item-unbound` and backs off rather than pressing blind. It landed on
   2026-08-30 in `b8d0d94`. The diagnosis below is kept because it is still the
   reason the call is there: Without it
   `itemnumber`, `itemtype` and `itemcost` are never written, and the observed
   consequences are exactly the ones in the capture logs: `itemcost` `NaN`,
   `itemnumber` stuck at 20, `hero.weapon` set to 20 whichever id was pressed,
   and 5 000 000 staged gold repaired down to 4 000 by `check_for_nan`. The
   existing `shop-operands-unreadable` guard is doing its job; the missing
   rollover is the cause it is guarding against.
2. **Same file, `WEAPON_PAGES`.** The order `hacking3, bashing3, slashing3,
   hacking2, …` is right for "highest tier first" but wastes two page loads for
   the recommended id 20, which is on `slashing3`. With a real table the page is
   a lookup: band = `ceil(id/20)`, page from the instance table in §1.2.
3. **Same file, `ARMOUR_PAGES = ["browse"]`.** The armoury has no item handlers
   on `browse` either; it needs the twenty per-piece page frames, or at minimum
   the pages for the piece the operator wants. As written, `-ShopArmour` can
   only ever reach `shop-unreachable`.
4. ~~**[`ss2-arena-route.md`](ss2-arena-route.md) §6.** Three corrections:~~
   ► **ALL THREE MADE — struck 2026-09-07.** `ss2-arena-route.md` now carries
   (a) the attribute gate at :1191 (*"`attribute_required` is the hero's
   governing attribute for the band"*), (b) the `fizMode == "fizzle"` derivation
   of `game_mode = "full"` at :595–618, which is what makes both refusals inert,
   and (c) the `item<n>`-only-on-category-pages point. The asks were: the
   weapon gate compares the item's level to the **hero's attribute**, not to
   anything on the item (§3.1); the `itemlevel > 16` / `itemlevel > 12`
   refusals are **inert** in this build, because root frame 1 sets
   `_root.fizMode = "fizzle"` and frame 10 derives `game_mode = "full"` from it
   (§3.3); and `_root.weaponsmith["item"+i]` exists only on the category pages,
   never at `browse` (§1).
5. ~~**[`ss2-battle-map.md`](ss2-battle-map.md).** It should record
   `min_damage = round(strength*2) + weapon_min_damage`, the matching
   `max_damage`, and the `[3]` / `[4]` table indices — that pair is the operand
   of every damage roll and is currently only described as derived.~~
   ► **MADE — struck 2026-09-07.** The battle map records all three: the `[3]` /
   `[4]` lookups at `weapon_min_damage`/`weapon_max_damage` (`+0x31be`,
   `+0x31da`) and both formulas, `min_damage = round(strength * 2) +
   weapon_min_damage` (`+0x3356`) and its `max` counterpart (`+0x3386`). Landed
   `0a3076c`, 2026-08-30 — two days before this page's own last edit.

**Items 1, 4 and 5 above are struck; 2 and 3 are still open.** *(The section
heading is deliberately unchanged: it is a statement of PROVENANCE — these are
changes this track does not make itself — not a running count of what remains.
A proposed rewrite of the heading into a repo-status claim was refuted on
2026-09-07.)*

The per-frame instance names in §1.2 and §3.2 come from the tool's structural
summary rather than from any action dump — filter `namedInstances` by `context`
for `sprite:1961` and `sprite:1909`:

```powershell
& $node tools/inspect-swf.mjs $swf --json
```

Every command above prints analysis only. Do not redirect decompiled game code
or assets into the repository. In particular the
`--references '"value":"weapon[0-9]+"'` output carries each item's display-name
string literal, which is why this document identifies items by id alone.

The live corroboration in §1.3 and §1.4 is read from files already committed
and needs no session:
