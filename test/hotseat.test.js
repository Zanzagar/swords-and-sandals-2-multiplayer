/**
 * The hot-seat runner is the only thing in this repository a person can play,
 * and an unplayed runner rots silently: nothing else imports it, so a rename in
 * `src/team/` breaks it without failing a single existing test. These drive the
 * real CLI as a subprocess — the way a person runs it — rather than importing
 * its internals, because the failure that matters is "the fight will not start".
 *
 * They assert BEHAVIOUR, not layout. Banner wording and bar glyphs are free to
 * change; a fight reaching a winner, the honesty banner naming the rule set's
 * verification tier, and identical seeds replaying identically are not.
