/**
 * Capture-campaign automation: manifest derivation and evidence coverage.
 *
 * The two modules under test are the bookkeeping half of the golden loop.
 * Neither may invent evidence, and neither may report an optimistic answer the
 * promotion gate would then refuse. The load-bearing test here is that
 * rebuilding a hand-written, already-committed capture manifest from the
 * observation records it cites reproduces its canonical digest exactly — the
 * digest a promoted golden already carries in
 * `provenance.captureManifestSha256`. If the builder and the hand-written
 * manifests ever disagree, a promoted golden's provenance stops being
 * reproducible, which is the one failure the manifest exists to prevent.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the licensed installation, Ruffle, or captures/.
 * Negative cases are built in memory from committed records (deep-cloned,
 * edited, re-sealed) and, where the code under test insists on reading a
 * repository layout off disk, from a throwaway mini-repo under the OS temp
 * directory that is removed again when the suite finishes.
