/**
 * Experimental-design contract for the post-tutorial candidate families:
 * `candidate-tournament-*` (the non-lethal path) and `candidate-armoured-*`
 * (the armour path).
 *
 * Why these families exist
 * ------------------------
 * Every promoted golden comes from one staged fight — a level-1 gladiator
 * against the tutorial prisoner, both unarmoured, `fight_mode` `"misc"`. That
 * staging is exhausted. The bytecode map of the post-tutorial route
 * (docs/integration/ss2-arena-route.md §3) establishes that `fight_mode`
 * `"tournament"` is reachable from the foyer once
 * `herolevel >= tournament_level_required` (4 for a fresh gladiator, arena
 * route §2), and that tournament opponents can carry armour
 * (arena route §"What this route does and does not unlock").
 *
 * Two rules become observable there and nowhere else:
 *
 *   - the defeat gate's FIRST-BLOOD term. The byte-verified gate
 *     (battle map §Defeat gate and death dispatch) is entered iff
 *     `hitpoints <= 0` OR (`hitpoints < hitpointsmax` AND the mode is not
 *     tournament). Outside tournament mode any hit that reaches hitpoints ends
 *     the fight, so a surviving hitpoint hit is a tournament-only observation;
 *   - every armour rule in `damagecharacter`, which is inert against a
 *     defender wearing nothing.
 *
 * What a capture can contradict
 * -----------------------------
 * The wrapper serves the injected tape from a tap on `Math.random` that
 * receives no arguments, so every emitted roll line's `label`, `min`, `max`,
 * `value` and `callSite` are copied from the tape — that is, from the fixture
 * under test (runtime-capture §What a match actually establishes). The channels
 * a capture GENUINELY observes are the ordered mutation trace, the semantic
 * events (hit/miss and the dispatched `defender_hurt` method), the result
 * event, the final state, the staged/observed `attack_direction` and
 * `fight_mode`, and the NUMBER of draws. Every fixture below is therefore
 * justified by naming the observed channel that would move if the rule it
 * encodes were wrong, and this suite asserts that naming.
 *
 * Every number asserted here is hand-derived from
 * docs/integration/ss2-battle-map.md and docs/integration/ss2-arena-route.md
 * and cited at its assertion. None of it was read back out of the resolver and
 * none of it came from a capture: these are predictions a later licensed
 * capture will confirm or refute.
 *
 * The opponent is a PARAMETER, and says so
 * ----------------------------------------
 * `randomise_gladiator` builds tournament ranks 2..N procedurally at the hero's
 * level, mixing `randomBetween` with `RandomNumber` opcodes (arena route §2),
 * and foyer frame 22 regenerates the whole field whenever
 * `_global.tournament_in_progress != true` — which is every fresh launch. The
 * field is inspectable before the first bout (`_root.game.villain1..N` at foyer
 * frame 36) but it is not reproducible across launches. The villain block of
 * every fixture here is therefore a DECLARED PROFILE, not a reachable staging:
 * a capture must read the ladder at foyer frame 36 and re-author the villain
 * block from the dump. Nothing about the rules under test moves when it does —
 * which is what `hit-roll` value 100 and the parameter-surface assertions below
 * are for.
