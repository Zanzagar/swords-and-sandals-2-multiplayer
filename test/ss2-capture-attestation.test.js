/**
 * The three capture attestations the wrapper mints on the trace's `end` line:
 * `overdraw` (draws the armed window made after the injected tape ran out),
 * `launchNonce` (an identity minted inside the player, which the operator did
 * not choose), and `staged` (the combatant fields the wrapper itself wrote
 * before the observed action).
 *
 * The first two used to be validated at ingest and then thrown away, so no
 * committed record carried either and a reviewer holding only the repository
 * could not check that the over-draw guard had ever been satisfied. `overdraw`
 * was also optional, which meant a trace without it silently carried no
 * assurance at all rather than failing loudly.
 *
 * `staged` answers a different question: not "was the capture sound" but "whose
 * scenario is this". 22 of the 23 promoted goldens rest on scenarios the game
 * itself produced; the armoured and tournament families cannot be reached that
 * way, so the wrapper writes combatant state directly.
 *
 * ► **That last sentence was a prediction when it was written, and it CAME
 *   TRUE on 2026-09-02.** `golden-armoured-deflection-threshold-cleared` is
 *   the first promoted golden with a `provenance.staged` string, and as of
 *   2026-09-07 it is still the only one. Measured, not counted from a brief.
 *   That is a legitimate
 * experimental input — the game still resolves the action — but it is a
 * materially different kind of evidence, and nothing in the repository
 * distinguished the two.
 *
 * This suite pins the whole chain: the fields are carried into the record, the
 * count is mandatory for `injected-tape-runtime` captures with exactly one
 * documented escape hatch, the nonce is a promotion-gate independence check,
 * staging must agree across the evidence for one fixture and must reach the
 * golden — and none of it disturbs the committed evidence, whose records
 * predate all three fields and must stay byte-identical.

 * the per-record `launchNonce` assertion, because four of the nine carry one.

 * give it a validator that rejects every value of the field — the single most
 * likely regression, since the promotion gate's own error message tells the
