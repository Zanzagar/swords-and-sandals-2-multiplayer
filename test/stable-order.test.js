/**
 * The locale-independence of every ordering this project's evidence depends on.
 *
 * ## What this file exists to stop happening again
 *
 * `localeCompare` is ICU-locale-dependent. Five places in this repository had
 * independently reached for it, and one of them — the capture-manifest session
 * tiebreak — sits inside the digest that all 23 promoted goldens cite as
 * `provenance.captureManifestSha256`. So two machines could mint two different,
 * equally "correct" digests for byte-identical evidence, in the one number that
 * is supposed to make a promotion reproducible.
 *
 * **None of that was caught by the suite, and it could not have been.** Every
 * id pair in the committed fixtures collates identically in every locale
 * tested, so a green run was never evidence either way — and the one test that
 * looked like it checked the manifest ordering
 * (`capture-campaign.test.js`) built its expected order with
 * `localeCompare` itself, so both sides of the assertion moved together.
 *
 * These tests therefore do NOT assert "the suite still passes". They assert the
 * property directly, against inputs chosen to make the two comparators
 * disagree. Every one of them fails if `byCodeUnit` is swapped back.
