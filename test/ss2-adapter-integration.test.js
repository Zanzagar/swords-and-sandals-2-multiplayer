/**
 * Integration: the shared team resolver and the SS2 adapter, driven together.
 *
 * `test/ss2-adapter.test.js` tests the adapter's parts in isolation and
 * `test/team-resolver.test.js` tests the resolver's. Nothing until this file
 * drove both as one thing: vanilla-shaped state in, converted to canonical,
 * resolved turn by turn, mirrored back into vanilla field writes and
 * presentation commands, through to one campaign settlement.
 *
 * Nothing here is runtime-verified. `classicStyleRules` is an explicit
 * placeholder, the animation labels are static-map at best, and only the
 * eighteen promoted goldens in `test/fixtures/ss2-1v1-golden/` are measured
 * against the licensed build. This file proves the two seams *compose*; it
 * says nothing about whether the maths is SS2's.

  // aiFilled, survived, health, maxHealth and statuses — nothing else. If a
  // record ever gains a resources block, re-derive this: the unmapped piece
  // above becomes a real defect at that moment.
