/**
 * What a committed test CAN prove about transcribed build data, and what it
 * cannot.
 *
 * `src/team/ss2-weapon-table.js` is ninety rows read out of the licensed
 * build's bytecode. **The oracle for those numbers is the build, and a fresh
 * clone does not have it** — so the check that actually matters is
 * `node tools/item-table-transcription.mjs`, which re-reads every literal and
 * every `battlevalues` reader index from the installed SWF and diffs both the
 * module and `docs/integration/ss2-item-tables.md` against them.
 *
 * This file deliberately does NOT try to stand in for that. The project has
 * already been burned once by an oracle computed from the table under test:
 * five of the eight `SS2_ARMOUR_DVAL` constants could be set to 500 with the
 * suite green, because every assertion about them was derived from them.
 *
 * So what is asserted here is only what is checkable WITHOUT the build, and
 * each assertion is a structural invariant that a corrupted or truncated
 * transcription violates:
 *
 * - the id set is exactly the ninety the build declares, by name;
 * - the band-to-type mapping holds across all eighty shop ids — an invariant
 *   `ss2-item-tables.md` §2.2 established from two independent directions
 *   (every literal's `[0]`, and the frame labels the ids sit on), so it is not
 *   a restatement of the rows themselves;
 *   ► **and it is the weakest assertion here, because both it and the rows
 *     come from the same transcription. It catches a scrambled or partial
 *     table. It cannot catch a table that is wrong the same way twice.**
 * - damage is ordered and positive, so a swapped min/max column fails;
 * - the module is frozen, so a caller cannot mutate build data in place.
 *
 * A mutation for each is named at its assertion, and each was run.
