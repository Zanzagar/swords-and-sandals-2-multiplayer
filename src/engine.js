/**
 * Deterministic team-combat foundation for an SS2 team-arena mod.
 *
 * This file is now a thin, compatibility-preserving façade over the shared
 * team seam in `src/team/`. 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 all run through
 * `src/team/resolver.js`; there is no separate 1v1 combat path.
 *
 * The formulas still live in `src/team/placeholder-rules.js` and are still
 * placeholders. They will be replaced by injecting a *second* rule set that
 * satisfies the contract in `src/team/rule-set.js`, once runtime-verified
 * goldens are promoted from the capture campaign. Nothing in the resolver,
 * roster, controller, elimination, or settlement modules changes at that
 * point — see `docs/ss2-adapter-contract.md`.
 *
 * External guarantees preserved by the façade: the action protocol, the
 * `toWireState` projection, `stateHash`, deterministic replay, and the
 * `ActionType` / `classicStyleRules` / `BattleError` exports.

/**
 * Stable, JSON-safe state for a host/client protocol or saved battle replay.
 *
 * This is the historical projection and keeps the historical `controller`
 * string per combatant. The controller-independent projection the seam
 * introduces is `toTeamWireState` / `combatStateHash`.
 *
 * **It is frozen at its historical field list on purpose**, which now means it
 * omits the canonical resource bag. Anything a rule set reads must be hashed
 * or the hash is not a desync check — so a battle whose rule set uses
 * resources must be compared with `combatStateHash`, not `stateHash`. See the
 * note on `stateHash` below.
 *
 * ► **AND IT CARRIES ITS OWN FROZEN VERSION, which it did not until 2026-09-13.**
 *   It used to project `battle.version`. That was harmless while the team
 *   resolver's version was a hand-written `1` that never changed — and the
 *   moment that version became DERIVED from the team wire format's shape, this
 *   façade's hash moved with it. **A projection frozen at a historical field
 *   list cannot take its version from a format it does not project**: this one
 *   carries neither `x`, nor `y`, nor the resource bag, so nothing that has
 *   changed the team version has ever changed THIS shape.
 *
 *   The test that caught it says so in its own name — "the pinned hashes do
 *   not move" — and it was right: the façade's six legacy hashes are
 *   byte-identical again, which is the evidence that deriving the team version
 *   stayed inside the team seam.
