/**
 * The vanilla SS2 field catalogue.
 *
 * This module is *data*: the names, groups, defaults, and citations for every
 * field the read-only battle map records on the persistent combat objects
 * (`_root.game.hero` / `_root.game.villain`) and on the runtime fighter clips
 * (`_root.arena.gladiators.hero` / `.villain`). It contains no formulas, no
 * derivations, and no combat decisions — deriving a value from these fields is
 * rule-set work, not adapter work.
 *
 * Every citation below is a section of `docs/integration/ss2-battle-map.md`.
 * Where the map is silent the constant says so explicitly and the accompanying
 * `MAP_SILENCE` entry names the capture that would settle it. Nothing in this
 * file may be presented as runtime-verified: the only runtime-verified
 * behaviour in the repository is what `test/fixtures/ss2-1v1-golden/` holds.
