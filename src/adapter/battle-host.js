/**
 * The reference host loop: the two seams, driven together.
 *
 * `src/team/` decides combat and `src/adapter/` converts and presents it, but
 * until this module nothing drove them as one thing. A host is what a real mod
 * would be: it reads vanilla combat objects, builds a team battle, submits one
 * action at a time, mirrors every resolved action back into vanilla field
 * writes and presentation commands, and finally acknowledges the result
 * animation so the campaign settles once.
 *
 * **It decides no combat.** There is no formula, no roll, no threshold and no
 * damage arithmetic here. Every value it moves was decided and clamped by the
 * resolver running the injected rule set; every write it produces comes out of
 * `vanillaWritesForResolvedAction`, which mirrors the resolver's post-action
 * projection. The host's own arithmetic is limited to array indices.
 *
 * Three things this module deliberately does **not** do, because doing them
 * would hide a real gap between the two seams:
 *
 * 1. it will not invent a vanilla combat object for an AI-filled slot. The
 *    roster invents the *combatant*; nothing invents its equipment, armour or
 *    inventory, so the caller must supply a template or the host refuses;
 * 2. it will not compute a vanilla value the resolver did not produce. An
 *    armour-first split reaches `armourclass` only because a rule set declared
 *    it as an ordered `resource` effect and the resolver applied and clamped
 *    it; the host writes the post-action projection and does no subtraction;
 * 3. it will not decorate, wrap or re-run the injected rule set. The resolver
 *    records what it applied on `battle.lastResolution`, so the effect list
 *    comes from `lastResolvedAction(battle)` — the authoritative trace of what
 *    actually happened, rather than a recording wrapper's guess at it.
 *
 * **The per-action animation gate (2026-09-07).** `submit` now stamps each
 * action's presentation commands with the resolver's own action boundary
 * (`lastResolvedAction(battle).firstEventSequence` — NOT `event.sequence`,
 * which is per event and would split a killing blow into four) and registers
 * that token with `src/adapter/action-gate.js`. Two things about it are
 * deliberate and easy to undo by accident:
 *
 * - **Nothing here ever calls `gate.report`.** Only the animation surface
 *   does, through `reportActionAnimation`. This is the same rule
 *   `acknowledgeResultAnimations` was rewritten to obey after it was found
 *   fabricating the death reports and the arena label it was itself waiting
 *   for: a gate that supplies its own evidence is not a gate.
 * - **It is advisory unless `awaitAnimations: true`.** Every headless caller —
 *   the goldens, the replay harness, the suite — has no surface to report
 *   from, and a gate that blocked them would wait forever. Enforcing hosts
 *   refuse in `submit` BEFORE `applyAction`, because an applied action cannot
 *   be taken back.
 *
 * Node builtins only; no assets, no game data.

 * declared none for this slot, which is the case the host fills in.
 *
 * A supplied gladiator gets its resources from its own combat object

 * template — and it goes on **that slot's own empty-slot marker**, which the
 * roster reads as the nearest and highest-priority fill source.
 *
 * This used to be a team-level injection, `{ ...team.aiFill, resources }`,
 * from when the roster carried one fill template per team and two disagreeing
 * templates had nowhere to both live. Two things were wrong with it. Filled
 * slots on such a team declared **no** resources at all, reported as
 * `diagnostics.aiFillResourceGaps`, and a rule set's write to one was refused
 * by the resolver. And once `aiFill` was allowed to be an array of per-slot
 * templates, spreading it into an object literal collapsed the whole array —
 * `{ ...[a, b] }` is `{ 0: a, 1: b }`, which the roster reads as one nameless
 * template applying to every slot, so every per-slot name, stat and loadout
 * the caller declared was silently discarded. Per-slot markers have neither
 * problem: nothing is merged across slots, so nothing has to agree about its
 * resources and there is no array to flatten.

   * refused") had nothing independent to compare against. A convenience that
   * supplies the evidence it is supposed to be checking is not a convenience.
   *
   * So: `deaths` names the fighters that reported, `arenaLabel` is the label
   * the surface actually reached, and `completionToken` is the token the

   * carries it too). A host with a real animation surface can still call
   * `bridge.reportDeathAnimation` / `bridge.reportArenaLabel` directly; this is
   * the batch form of exactly those calls and grants no extra authority.
   *
   * **A draw stops after the deaths.** Vanilla's `death()` dispatches only
   * `combatwon`/`combatlost`, so a drawn battle has no arena transition to
   * report and the completed death animations are the entire acknowledgement.
   * Passing an `arenaLabel` for one is still reported — and still refused —
   * because a surface that reached a result label for a draw disagrees with
   * resolved state.
