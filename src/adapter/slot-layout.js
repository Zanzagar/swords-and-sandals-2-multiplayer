/**
 * The two-sided problem: mapping a 1v1, 2v2 or 3v3 roster onto a vanilla
 * surface that is hard-coded for exactly two sides.
 *
 * The vanilla surface has three two-sided things (battle map, "Battle entry
 * and timeline ownership", "Combatant state objects", "UI and movie-clip map"):
 *
 * 1. two fighter clips, `hero` (depth 301) and `villain` (depth 300), under
 *    `_root.arena.gladiators`, each with a mirrored shadow at 298/299;
 * 2. two persistent combat objects, `_root.game.hero` and `_root.game.villain`;
 * 3. a `combat_panel` whose named instances are all `hero_*` / `villain_*`.
 *
 * The resolution is *not* to clone hero and villain per slot. The map warns
 * against exactly that ("it should not multiply the existing hero/villain
 * globals"), and it would break the original callbacks, which compare a clip
 * against `arena.gladiators.villain` or `.hero` by identity.
 *
 * The resolution is that **the vanilla two-sided surface is a binding, not a
 * roster.** The combat controller "repeatedly binds the current pair into four
 * globals" — `attacker` / `defender` (clips) and `game_attacker` /
 * `game_defender` (state objects) — and the mapped combat functions take those
 * as parameters (`attack_chances(game_attacker, game_defender)`,
 * `damagecharacter(defender, attacker, game_defender, game_attacker, ...)`,
 * `check_stats(game_defender)`). A 3v3 has six combatants but still exactly one
 * ordered (attacker, defender) pair per resolved action. So:
 *
 * - **sides** carry teams: one team is the hero side, the other the villain side;
 * - **slots** carry combatants: slot 0 of each side reuses the vanilla clip
 *   name, depth and position exactly, so 1v1 is byte-for-byte the vanilla
 *   arrangement and remains the parity gate;
 * - **the four globals are rebound per action** from resolved state, so the
 *   original callbacks always target the right unit;
 * - **state lives in the adapter's mirror**, keyed by combatant id, not in
 *   multiplied `_root.game.*` objects. The vanilla campaign objects are read
 *   once when the battle is built and written back only at settlement, which
 *   is what the roadmap's "do not overwrite vanilla save fields while the
 *   adapter is experimental" constraint requires.
 *
 * Everything about slots beyond the first is authored mod surface. Vanilla has
 * no second ally, so no capture can settle its geometry; see
 * `MAP_SILENCE.multi-slot-arena-geometry`.
