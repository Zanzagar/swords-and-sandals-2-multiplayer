/**
 * Vanilla combat state <-> canonical combatant state.
 *
 * This is a pure, total, two-way mapping and nothing else. It has no formulas,
 * no rolls, no thresholds, and no arithmetic on combat values: **every vanilla
 * field write it produces is an absolute assignment that mirrors a value the
 * resolver already decided and already clamped.** That is the structural
 * reason the adapter cannot become a second place where combat is decided — it
 * can only copy. If a future edit here starts computing an outcome, it belongs
 * in a rule set (`src/team/rule-set.js`), not in this file.
 *
 * **That sentence used to be a description; it is now a check.** Two of them,
 * in fact, and they are what make the claim inspectable rather than a promise:
 *
 * - every write declares a `source` from a closed four-value set (`WriteSource`),
 *   and the source fixes which vanilla fields the write may target
 *   (`ALLOWED_WRITE_FIELDS`) — a set defined here, not per scenario;
 * - `assertWriteProvenance` then requires each write's `to` to be `===` the
 *   value the post-action projection actually holds at the canonical location
 *   its source names. A computed value has no such location to be identical
 *   to, so `to: before - amount` cannot be expressed at all.
 *
 * The read side has the same discipline: `toCanonicalCombatantSource` refuses
 * a vanilla record missing a base stat rather than defaulting it, and emits
 * only the `loadout` keys a named vanilla field answers, so an assumption the
 * record cannot support does not silently override the roster's own default.
 *
 * Totality: `normaliseVanillaCombatant` preserves every own key of its input,
 * including keys the battle map does not name (the unnamed timed `spell_*`
 * fields, and anything a future build adds). Only three things are treated
 * specially, each because the map says so:
 *
 * 1. the six status flags are **undefined until something sets them**, so they
 *    are materialised to `false` and the materialisation is recorded;
 * 2. `gladiator_dir` is **clip-resident**, so it is lifted out of the combat
 *    object into a separate clip record and written back only to the clip;
 * 3. everything else round-trips byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Citations are sections of `docs/integration/ss2-battle-map.md`.
