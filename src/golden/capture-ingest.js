/**
 * Convert one raw capture trace into a validated observation record for the
 * given target fixture. The fixture determines which staged fields become the
 * observation scenario; the recorded values are always the observed ones, so
 * a mis-staged scenario surfaces later as an explicit fixture mismatch.
 *
 * Two unrelated senses of "staged" meet here. The trace's `state` lines are the
 * pre-action dump — the scenario as it stood, however it came to stand that
 * way. `end.staged` is narrower and is about authorship: the fields the WRAPPER
 * itself wrote. A trace can have a full staged dump and no `end.staged` at all,
 * and every trace behind 22 of the 23 promoted goldens does. The 23rd,
 * `golden-armoured-deflection-threshold-cleared`, is the exception in both
 * halves: its wrapper staged the scenario, so its trace carries `end.staged`
 * and its provenance carries the resulting `staged` string.
 *
 * Options:
 * - `installHashVerifiedAfter` — supply the live post-session hash result when
 *   the trace carries the wrapper's `null` placeholder.
 * - `allowMissingOverdraw` — accept an `injected-tape-runtime` trace whose end
 *   line has no `overdraw`. This exists for exactly one purpose: the archived
 *   raw traces under the ignored `captures/` directory predate the field, and
 *   regenerating divergence reports from them must not be blocked by evidence
 *   they could not have recorded. **The ratio is deliberately NOT quoted here.**
 *   It said "113 of 177" and was stale by 2026-09-01, when the same count read
 *   153 of 221 — and it moved again by three files DURING the audit that caught
 *   it, because a capture run was writing to the archive at the time. The
 *   archive is outside the repo and grows; a number about it is a number that
 *   rots. Re-derive at the moment you need it:
 *   count the archive's JSONL files carrying `"overdraw"` against the total —
 *   `find <archive> -name` with a star-dot-jsonl pattern, piped to grep. Written
 *   in prose because a glob containing a star-slash inside this comment block
 *   closes it and breaks the module; that is not hypothetical, it happened while
 *   writing this note, and the first prose version then dropped the star and
 *   named a pattern matching nothing. Codex caught that.
 *   What is stable is a fact about the ARCHIVE, not about this parser: every
 *   archived trace carries `overdraw` and `launchNonce` together or carries
 *   neither — 153 both, 68 neither, 0 mismatched at last count. **The parser
 *   does NOT enforce that pairing**: the two checks are independent, so with
 *   this hatch enabled a trace missing only one of them still ingests. An
 *   earlier version of this note claimed the option "waives a coupled pair,
 *   never a lone field", which described the data and not the code. The live
 *   capture path — `tools/capture-session.mjs` and
 *   `tools/runtime-capture/campaign.mjs` — must never pass it, and does not: a
 *   record ingested under this option carries no `capture.overdraw`, so it
 *   openly claims nothing rather than claiming zero.
