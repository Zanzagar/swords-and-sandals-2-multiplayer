/**
 * Promotion gate from static candidate fixtures to runtime-observed goldens.
 *
 * A candidate is promoted only when at least two matching observations from
 * at least two independent capture sessions exist, every one of them carries a
 * player-minted `capture.launchNonce` (or is one of the enumerated records
 * that predate the field), no two of them share a nonce, they agree about
 * whether the wrapper staged the scenario, every observation is covered by a
 * validated capture manifest, and each observation's digest verifies. Any
 * divergent observation blocks promotion and yields a divergence report that
 * must be preserved instead of discarded.
 *
 * A golden promoted from wrapper-staged evidence carries that fact in
 * `provenance.staged`, so the fixture says so on its own face rather than
 * leaving a reader to follow observation ids back to their records. See
 * `assertGoldenCanRecordStaging` below for the one schema change that is
 * currently outstanding on this.

  // THIS LOOP HAS TEETH. 751 of 11,121 single-leaf perturbations across the 67
  // committed records are FREE — valid, re-digested, and still matching their
  // candidate — and 407 of them, every one at `/samples/*/callSite`, are

  // than a sample: a leaf the matcher compares cannot be free, because every
  // record matches its fixture at baseline, so FREE is exactly the set of
  // matcher-blind leaves that admit any valid alternative value.
  //
  // TWO CLAIMS THAT STOOD HERE ARE WITHDRAWN, and they failed in opposite
  // directions:
  //
  //   "ZERO can differ ... so this loop cannot currently refuse anything" —
  //   FALSE, and false on what is almost certainly its own record. obs-qk1
  //   carries 163 full-record leaves, 162 probeable (the 163rd is `digest`,
  //   which any probe must rewrite), and TEN of those 162 are free.
  //
  //   "the leaf COUNT does not reproduce ... NO record has 162 under either" —
  //   also FALSE. 162 reproduces exactly; it is full-record leaves MINUS the
  //   digest, for obs-qk1 and ten siblings, and 142 is that same record's
  //   matcher projection. That retraction measured two surfaces the original
  //   claim never used. The count was right and only the conclusion was wrong.
  //
  // THIS LOOP IS NOW REACHABLE FROM COMMITTED EVIDENCE, AND IT WAS NOT BEFORE.
  // Do not restate the paragraph this replaces without re-measuring it.
  //
  // What stood here, and was true when written: ZERO of the observation ids
  // the 22 goldens cited carried a `capture.launchNonce`; each was waived only
  // by having its exact digest listed in `pre-nonce-observations.js`; every
  // forgery re-digests, so each dropped out of the waiver and was refused by
  // the nonce check above — which `defer`s and throws roughly forty lines
  // BEFORE this loop is reached. Excising the loop changed zero verdicts.
  //
  // Re-promoting the four self-citing normal-band goldens off their own
  // transcription sources moved that. The goldens now cite 60 distinct
  // records, NINE of which carry a nonce (obs-cachecold, obs-cachewarm,
  // obs-iso2, obs-par1-3, obs-pq1-3), spread across four goldens. Forging one
  // of those nine leaves the waiver irrelevant, so the refusal falls through
  // to this loop. `test/capture-campaign.test.js` pins the prediction rather
  // than either count: forging a nonce-free cited record must be refused by
  // the NONCE gate, forging a nonce-bearing one by THIS loop, and both
  // branches must be non-empty — if the pairwise count returns to zero the
  // gate is unreachable again and this comment is wrong again.
  //
  // BUT STILL DO NOT READ "HAS TEETH" AS "THIS GATE IS PROTECTING THE CORPUS."
  // Reachable is not the same as load-bearing: what reaches it are FORGERIES
  // the tests construct, and on honest evidence the loop refuses nothing that
  // already stands.
  //
  // AND THE TEETH ARE NARROWER THAN THE COUNT SUGGESTS. All 407 committed
  // samples carry ONE callSite literal, because the wrapper has one roll
  // emitter stamping one compile-time constant — the same fact that makes a
  // fixture-derived callSite comparison a thing this project has refused to
  // add. So these teeth cannot bite two honest captures. And this loop catches
  // DISAGREEMENT, never falsehood: two records carrying the SAME fabricated
  // callSite agree, match, and promote. Nothing here closes the open hook
  // attribution hole, and nothing here should be described as closing it.
  //
  // It exists because the hole opens the moment any field stops being compared
  // against the fixture. An auditor demonstrated exactly that: with the
  // prescribed `staminaleft` exclusion patched in, two records differing by
  // 99,992 stamina — one negative, one 10^13 above `staminamax` — both matched
  // the candidate and both promoted. That is the second symptom of the debris
  // forgery closed in cc42503, where two observations differing by 120
  // fabricated draws corroborated each other.
  //
  // `ss2ObservationsMatch` has existed and been exercised by tests the whole
  // time; it was simply never called from the promotion path, so "two matching
  // observations from two independent sessions" has always meant two records
  // that each resembled the same prediction, never two that resembled one

  // cite, this loop is unreachable behind the nonce check, so an exclusion
  // landed today is backstopped by NOTHING here. "The pairwise gate covers it"

  // — it would have been under the old, wrong reading. The exclusion still
  // needs its own adversarial pass against the named claim "a record carrying
  // an arbitrary `staminaleft` cannot be promoted", and this loop only starts
  // helping once the evidence being promoted carries launch nonces.

/**
 * A golden must say on its own face that its scenario was wrapper-staged.
 *
 * The alternative designs were considered and rejected. Leaving the fact only
 * in the cited observation records makes a reader chase ids through
 * `test/observations/` to learn something that changes how the fixture should
 * be read — the project's own rule is that evidence a reviewer holding the
 * repository cannot check is evidence that is not there. Refusing staged
 * evidence outright would be worse still: staging is the only route to the
 * `candidate-armoured-*` per-piece values and to a reproducible hero entering
 * the tournament rank-1 bout, and the ingest pipeline was built expecting
 * staged scenarios. So the golden records it, in one optional provenance field
 * whose absence carries the same meaning it does on a record.
 *
 * The field is currently REFUSED by the shared fixture schema:
 * `GOLDEN_PROVENANCE_KEYS` in src/golden/run-1v1-fixture.js is a closed set and
 * does not contain `staged`. That file is owned by another track, so this gate
 * fails loudly with the exact change required rather than quietly dropping the
 * field — a golden that silently looked game-produced is precisely the outcome
 * this whole field exists to prevent. Unstaged promotions are untouched by any
 * of this: they add no key, so they never reach the refusal.
