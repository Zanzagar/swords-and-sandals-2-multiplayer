/**
 * SS2's own arithmetic, wired into the shared team resolver. MAP-DERIVED.
 *
 * This is the first rule set in the repository that is not invented. Every
 * number it produces is either read out of the licensed build's bytecode (via
 * `docs/integration/ss2-battle-map.md`, which carries the offsets) or computed
 * by `src/golden/ss2-attack-candidate.js`, the module the 22 promoted goldens
 * already replay against. Until this file existed the corpus fed nothing: the
 * resolver ran `placeholder-rules.js`, and 22 runtime-verified fixtures sat in
 * `test/fixtures/` with no consumer.
 *
 * ## What tier this is, and why it is not higher
 *
 * `map-derived`, and it declares `runtimeVerified: false`. No capture session
 * has ever observed THIS MODULE driving a fight. What the goldens back is the
 * attack ingress it delegates to, for directions 1-12 only. Everything else
 * here — the stamina economy, action legality, the AI policy — is derived from
 * the map and has never been observed at all. The provenance note says so, the
 * hot-seat banner prints the tier, and `rule-set.js` refuses the claim of
 * runtime verification outright.
 *
 * ## The vocabulary is three verbs and a rest, and the direction is DRAWN
 *
 * A player does not choose an `attack_direction` in SS2. `power_attack`,
 * `normal_attack` and `quick_attack` each draw one — `randomBetween(9, 12)` at
 * `+0x608a`, `randomBetween(5, 8)` at `+0x61f1`, `randomBetween(1, 4)` at
 * `+0x635c` (map § "Where `attack_direction` is assigned") — before calling
 * `checkattackroll`. The map states it plainly: the direction "is recorded,
 * never dictated".
 *
 * So the direction is a draw on the ordered channel, not a token in the action
 * vocabulary. That is the opposite of the obvious design — encoding twelve
 * directions as twelve action types — and the obvious design would have handed
 * the player a choice the build does not give them, which is a parity claim
 * nothing measured.
 *
 * `rest` is in the vocabulary because without it a fight deadlocks: the
 * attacker pays `staminacost` on every phase transition (`nextphase`
 * `+0x32a7`), and at `staminaleft <= 0` overlay frame 1 forces
 * `getphase("rest")` (`+0x0d2e`).
 *
 * Deferred, each for a stated reason: `bash_attack` (needs a `criticalhit`
 * inherited across actions, which the resolver has no channel for),
 * `bombard`/`snipe` (need `using_bow`, a `swap_weapons` turn and an
 * `ammo_left` model), `psyche_up` (needs a three-turn counter and a position
 * model), `taunt` (the candidate implements only the post-`checkattackroll`
 * arm, so it would consume the wrong number of samples). None of the four has
 * a single golden.
 *
 * ## What reaches the arithmetic, and how
 *
 * `resolveSs2PhysicalAttackCandidate` reads ~40 vanilla fields. The resolver's
 * combatant carries seven stats, five loadout keys, a numeric resource bag and
 * a status list — and `roster.normaliseCombatant` rebuilds `stats` and
 * `loadout` as fixed-key literals, so a blueprint's extra keys are dropped.
 * Everything SS2-specific therefore travels as a **resource** (numbers) or a
 * **status** (strings), which is exactly what those two channels exist for:
 * both are on the view AND on the projection, so `combatStateHash` covers
 * every PER-COMBATANT input this rule set reads.
 *
 * That sentence used to end "covers every input this rule set reads. Nothing
 * reaches it through a side channel", and a verifier broke it. Two things are
 * read that the hash does not cover, and neither is this module's to fix:
 *
 * - **the RNG samples in tape mode.** `toTeamWireState` carries `rngState` and
 *   `rngCursor`, but a tape channel's `state` is a constant 0, so only the
 *   cursor moves. Two peers with different tapes hash identically until they
 *   diverge. Projecting the channel mode and a digest of the samples would
 *   close it; that is a resolver-contract change with its own decision.
 * - **the `observer` option**, which is not in the rule-set id and not in the
 *   projection. It is handed a deep clone precisely so it cannot reach the
 *   objects `battle.events` holds.
 *
 * `gladiator_dir` is the one input that cannot be a resource — resources are
 * finite numbers by construction — so it travels as the status token
 * `facing-left` (absent means "right", matching the candidate's own default).
 * It is load-bearing on the RNG: facing decides the armour-debris draw's
 * source and bounds, so getting it wrong desyncs a tape rather than merely
 * moving a number.
 *
 * ## The adapter path works for AI-filled slots and not for supplied ones
 *
 * **Corrected 2026-09-02. This section previously said "A battle built through
 * `src/adapter/` therefore cannot feed this rule set", and that is FALSE** — a
 * verifier built one and fought a 28-step battle through it. The claim was
 * mine and it was over-general in the direction that discourages someone from
 * trying; it is corrected here rather than deleted because it was cited as a
 * known limitation in `HANDOFF.md`.
 *
 * What is true: `CANONICAL_RESOURCE_SOURCES` (`src/adapter/state-bridge.js`) is
 * a closed list carrying none of the eight armour piece ids, `min_damage`,
 * `max_damage`, `character_level`, `equipped_weapon` or `herolevel`. What that
 * blocks is the **supplied-gladiator** path only, because
 * `toCanonicalCombatantSource` hard-codes the bag and takes no `resources`
 * option.
 *
 * An **AI-filled slot** has no combat object, so its bag comes from the
 * caller's own template, and `declaredFillResources`
 * (`src/adapter/battle-host.js`) reads `resources` straight off `team.aiFill`
 * — bypassing `CANONICAL_RESOURCE_SOURCES` entirely. So
 * `createVanillaBattleHost({ teams: [...aiFill.resources from ss2Combatant()],
 * rules: ss2TeamRules })` constructs, resolves actions, and emits real vanilla
 * writes with `unmapped: []`.
 *
 * Also corrected: the refusal is NOT `maximumHealth`'s. On the supplied path
 * the throw that actually fires names `max_damage, min_damage` — `staminaleft`
 * and `staminamax` ARE in `CANONICAL_RESOURCE_SOURCES`, so only two of the four
 * required names are missing. Anyone debugging this from the old wording went
 * to the wrong throw.
 *
 * ► **AND THE THROW MOVED AGAIN (2026-09-07), so the paragraph above is now
 *   right about the names and wrong about the moment.** The requirement is
 *   ROLE-BASED: `max_damage`/`min_damage` are demanded of whoever ATTACKS,
 *   from `vanillaRecordOf(view, "attacker")` when the swing resolves — NOT at
 *   construction, and never of a pure defender. So a supplied gladiator on
 *   that path now BUILDS, and fails on its own first swing instead. The
 *   function is `assertDeclaredResources`; `assertRequiredResources` no longer
 *   exists.
 *
 * Widening the canonical list is still real work with its own evidence
 * requirements; it is not done here.
 *
 * ## Two honest gaps, named because a silent one would be a lie
 *
 * 1. **First blood is not representable.** The candidate ends a `duel` or
 *    `misc` bout at `hitpoints < hitpointsmax`; the resolver decides
 *    elimination on `health > 0` alone and knows nothing else. Rather than
 *    drop the result event, this rule set THROWS when the arithmetic produces
 *    a first-blood outcome — and that throw is NOT free: it fires after the
 *    action's draws have already advanced the authoritative RNG state and
 *    cursor, which `combatStateHash` covers and `applyAction` cannot roll
 *    back. A caller that catches it holds a battle no replay of the accepted
 *    action log reproduces. So `duel` and `misc` are refused AT CONSTRUCTION
 *    unless the caller passes `fixtureReplay: true`, which is what the golden
 *    replay does; the in-action throw is a backstop behind that gate, not a
 *    routine path.
 *
 *    Worth knowing while reading that: `tournament` — the mode play uses —
 *    was, until 2026-09-02, the one mode of the build's three that no capture
 *    in this repository had ever observed. **That is no longer true**:
 *    `golden-armoured-deflection-threshold-cleared` declares
 *    `fightMode: "tournament"`, so 22 of the 23 goldens are `misc` and one is
 *    not. The mode play uses now has exactly one runtime-verified fixture
 *    behind it, which is one, not coverage.
 * 2. **The AI policy is invented, apart from one gate.** Only
 *    `villainChooseAction`'s unconditional `staminaleft > 10` is byte-decoded.
 *    Target choice and the choice among the three verbs are this module's own.
 *
 * 3. **`weapon_min_damage` / `weapon_max_damage` are unmodelled — but NOT
 *    because they are underivable.** `ss2BattleValues` takes them as
 *    caller-supplied inputs.
 *
 *    **Corrected 2026-09-02.** This gap used to end "so it cannot produce a
 *    gladiator's damage pair from a character record alone", which is wrong,
 *    and wrong in a way that made the gap look closed by nature rather than
 *    open by omission. The build's lookup is
 *    `_root["weapon" + whichcharacter.weapon][3]` and `[4]` (`+0x31be`,
 *    `+0x31da`) — keyed on `weapon`, a field ON the character record, into a
 *    STATIC literal table declared in the same root-frame-35 block
 *    (`weapon24 = Array(3, "Hatchet", 4, 8, 32, 1)` at `+0x41c6`, one entry per
 *    weapon id). So the pair IS derivable from a character record plus a
 *    transcription of build-constant data — data no different in status from
 *    the `_global.<piece>_dval` constants this module already transcribes.
 *
 *    What actually blocks it is two omissions, both closable: `weapon` is not
 *    a declarable field in `SS2_RESOURCE_NAMES`, `CANONICAL_RESOURCE_SOURCES`
 *    or `COMBATANT_KEYS`; and the table is not transcribed ~~into this
 *    repository~~ **INTO CODE — corrected 2026-09-02, because the unqualified
 *    sentence sent the ranked next step off to redo finished work.**
 *    `docs/integration/ss2-item-tables.md` has carried the transcription since
 *    2026-08-30: §2.3 for weapon ids 1-80, §2.4 for id 0 and the nine off-shop
 *    ids, EACH ROW WITH THE INSTRUCTION OFFSET OF ITS OWN LITERAL, and §2.1
 *    for what every array index means. Two rows were re-read from the bytes on
 *    2026-09-02 and matched; the other 88 have never been checked, so what
 *    this module needs first is a MECHANICAL diff of that document against the
 *    build, not a fresh transcription. That document also settles the boundary
 *    question this work runs into — display names are game content and are not
 *    reproduced; items are addressed by id.
 *
 *    Note the battle map has the same hole and is what made the error
 *    reachable: it records `min_damage = round(strength*2) + weapon_min_damage`
 *    and never records where `weapon_min_damage` itself comes from, so anyone
 *    following the standing "derive from the map" rule concludes it is an
 *    input. Corrected there too.
 *
 * 4. **Enchantment DAMAGE is computed and never APPLIED, on both weapons.**
 *    `weapon_enchantment_damage` (`+0x320c`) and
 *    `secondary_weapon_enchantment_damage` (`+0x3326`) are each
 *    `ceil(<max_damage> / 3 * <potency>)`. Both ARE derived below (see
 *    `ss2BattleValues`) and both are in the adapter catalogue
 *    (`src/adapter/vanilla-fields.js`) — an earlier version of this line said
 *    "neither is computed here" and "the catalogue carries only the primary",
 *    which was stale the day `52bc570` landed both. What is still missing is
 *    the APPLICATION: in the build the damage arrives as a status phase that
 *    REPLACES the afflicted combatant's next turn (battle map § "The
 *    enchantment effect is a SKIPPED TURN"), and this rule set has no such
 *    phase — so an enchanted weapon applies a status and deals no magic damage.
 *
 *    Do NOT confuse this with the enchantment PROC, which is modelled and is
 *    correct: the proc gate reads the PRIMARY potency for both weapons, and
 *    `src/golden/ss2-attack-candidate.js`'s `activeEnchantment` documents the
 *    bytes. That pairing has been flagged as a bug once already and is not one.
 *
 * Node builtins only.
