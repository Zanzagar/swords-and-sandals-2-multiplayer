/**
 * The one shared turn/action resolver.
 *
 * 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 are the same code path with a different slot count. There
 * is no second combat implementation anywhere in this repository, and adding
 * one would be the single most damaging thing a future change could do.
 *
 * What the resolver guarantees to any injected rule set:
 *
 * - it is called at most once per action, only for a legal action, only on the
 *   combatant whose turn it is;
 * - every random value it needs arrives through one ordered, labelled channel
 *   in the order it asks for them; the resolver draws nothing itself;
 * - it sees frozen views, never live state, so it cannot mutate the battle
 *   out from under the resolver;
 * - everything it can see, the projection carries — and therefore the state
 *   hash covers. That is what makes the hash a real desync check rather than
 *   one that agrees right up to the moment two peers diverge, and it is why
 *   the canonical resource bag (`resources.js`) is on both the view and the
 *   projection rather than reaching a rule set through a side channel;
 * - its declarative effects are applied in order and clamped, its events are
 *   stamped with sequence and turn and appended in order;
 * - knockouts, team elimination, the battle result, and campaign settlement
 *   are computed afterwards by the resolver, not by the rule set.
 *
 * Determinism: same blueprint + same ordered action stream => identical
 * combat state hash, for every team size.

 * A whole team is down. Record it, freeze the battle result, and arm — but do

 * The settlement is armed with a **battle discriminator** as well as the
 * outcome, because the outcome alone does not identify a battle. Two bouts
 * between the same two teams ending the same way are the delivery target here
 * — a networked campaign of consecutive bouts — and without a discriminator
 * they share a completion token, so bout 1's `battle-result-animation-complete`
 * satisfies bout 2's second gate and settles it with bout 1's winner.
 *
 * The discriminator is `combatStateHash(battle)` read *here*: after the result
 * and the `team-eliminated` events are on the battle and before the settlement
 * is armed. That ordering matters twice over.
 *
 * - It is late enough to cover this battle's whole terminal state — seed, RNG
 *   cursor, rosters, healths, statuses, initiative, turn number and the entire
 *   ordered event log — so two genuinely independent bouts differ in it.
 * - It is early enough that the hash cannot see the token it is about to go
 *   into. `toTeamWireState` carries `settlement.toJSON()`, which is still the
 *   unarmed constant at this line, so there is no circularity to resolve.
 *
 * It stays a pure function of this battle's own play: a replay of the same
 * blueprint and the same ordered actions reaches the identical terminal state
 * and therefore the identical token. A counter or a random value would have
 * discriminated just as well and broken deterministic replay, which is why
 * neither is used.
