/**
 * SS2's static weapon table, transcribed from the licensed build.
 *
 * `battlevalues` does not take a gladiator's damage pair as an input. It looks
 * it up: `c.weapon_min_damage = _root["weapon" + c.weapon][3]` (`+0x31be`) and
 * `[4]` (`+0x31da`), where `_root.weapon<N>` is one of ninety six-element array
 * literals declared in a single run at `root/frame:35/DoAction@0x3fa9dc`,
 * inside a `With` whose scope object is `weapons_table`. So a gladiator's
 * damage pair IS derivable from a character record — the missing piece was
 * only ever this table.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-02 both `HANDOFF.md` and this module's own sibling said "the
 * table is not transcribed", and a ranked next step told the next session to
 * transcribe it. It had been transcribed on 2026-08-30, into
 * `docs/integration/ss2-item-tables.md` §2.3 and §2.4.
 *
 * ## What each column is, and why the display name is not here
 *
 * The literal is `Array(type, name, weight, min, max, range)`, so index `[1]`
 * is a display-name string. **Item display names are game content and are not
 * reproduced anywhere in this repository** — the boundary `ss2-item-tables.md`
 * set when it recorded the table, and the reason items are addressed by id
 * throughout the capture tooling. Index `[1]` is therefore absent below rather
 * than blanked, so nobody can mistake an empty string for a name the build
 * lacks.
 *
 * `[2]` is an index into `weaponweights` and is also the character's
 * `attack_speed` (`battlevalues` `+0x3174` and `+0x346a`). `[5]` is a range
 * multiplier, not a range: `weapon_range = physical_size + [5] * 44`
 * (`+0x3190`).
 *
 * ## How this stays honest
 *
 * This is build DATA, and the project's rule for build data is that the only
 * honest oracle is the build. So it is not checked against a doc, a fixture or
 * a golden — `node tools/item-table-transcription.mjs` re-reads the ninety
 * literals out of the installed SWF and diffs THIS MODULE and the document
 * against them, and separately confirms from `battlevalues`'s own
 * `Push <n>; GetMember` sites that the column meanings above are the build's
 * rather than a convention the transcription invented.
 *
 * The tests that ship with the repository can only check structure, because a
 * fresh clone has no licensed build. They say so where they are written; they
 * are not the guarantee. The tool is.
 *
 * Node builtins only.
 */

/**
 * One row per weapon id: `[id, type, weight, minDamage, maxDamage, rangeMultiplier]`.
 *
 * A flat array of tuples rather than objects, because it is transcribed data
 * and a diff of it should read like a diff of the build.

/**
 * WHICH BOW a secondary damage pair belongs to — the only honest route this

 *
 * ► **WHY IT IS NEEDED AT ALL.** The build picks the arrow's art with
 *   `bullet.gotoAndStop(game_attacker.secondary_weapon - 60)` (`+0x6dd4`), and
 *   **equipment identity deliberately does not survive into the resolver** —
 *   `ss2Combatant`'s own comment calls the weapon id "the only place the weapon
 *   id still exists". So by the time a presentation surface has an arrow to
 *   draw, the id is long gone.
 *
 *   What IS carried is `secondary_weapon_min_damage` /
 *   `secondary_weapon_max_damage`: the weapon table's own raw columns, in the
 *   resource bag since the ranged vocabulary landed, because the swing needs
 *   them. Those columns are keyed by id in the build's own table, so looking
 *   one up is a TABLE READ rather than an inference.
 *
 * ► **AND THE STRENGTH OF IT IS STATED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, because this
 *   repository has withdrawn an inversion claim before.** `ss2Reach`'s header
 *   records that 432 of 3,004 archive records invert AMBIGUOUSLY across the
 *   whole ninety-row table. That is true and it is about a different question:
 *   the PRIMARY pair over every row.
 *
 *   Restricted to the ranged band, measured: **all twenty `(min, max)` pairs
 *   are distinct**, so within the band the lookup is exact. The restriction is
 *   the build's own — `buyweapon` routes a ranged purchase to
 *   `secondary_weapon` and nothing else reaches that slot through the shop
 *   (ss2-item-tables.md:826-828, the same citation
 *   `assertSs2WeaponPurchasable` already carries).
 *
 *   **Every ranged pair DOES collide with a melee row** — (4,16) is ids 2, 21
 *   and 61 — which is exactly why this searches the band and never the table.
 *   A gladiator carrying a sword in the secondary slot is a state the shop
 *   cannot produce; this returns null for it rather than guessing a bow.
