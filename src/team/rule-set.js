/**
 * The seam: what a rule set must provide to drive the shared team resolver.
 *
 * This module contains no formulas. It is the typed injection point a rule set
 * is dropped into, and the gate that keeps an unverified formula from
 * *claiming* to be verified.
 *
 * Three tiers, and the middle one carries the weight: `placeholder` is invented,
 * `map-derived` was read out of the licensed build's bytecode with partial
 * golden backing, and `runtime-verified` was observed running. **Only
 * `runtime-verified` may set `runtimeVerified: true`** — a map-derived rule set
 * declares `false` and cites its map sections and goldens instead.
 *
 * A rule set owns: the action vocabulary, legality, the outcome of one action
 * (including which RNG draws it makes, in what order), the derived maximum
 * health, and the AI policy.
 *
 * The resolver owns, and a rule set can neither see nor change: turn order,
 * team/slot structure, controller identity, effect application and clamping,
 * event sequencing, knockout and team-elimination detection, and campaign
 * settlement.

 * stamina, ammunition, and every resource a future rule set invents. See
