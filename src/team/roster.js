/**
 * Teams, slots, combatant identity, and AI fill.
 *
 * A team owns one to three *slots*. Every slot has a stable seat id and holds
 * exactly one combatant. An unoccupied slot is filled with an ordinary
 * combatant whose seat is assigned to the AI controller — the filled fighter
 * is not a special case anywhere downstream, which is the point: there is no
 * second code path for AI allies.
 *
 * Combatant identity (who is fighting) and controller identity (who is driving
 * the seat) are produced here as two separate structures.
 *
 * ## The fill source is per slot
 *
 * `team.aiFill` used to be one template for the whole team, which is fine
 * while every filled slot is interchangeable and wrong as soon as one is not.
 * The concrete case is the SS2 adapter: each filled slot mirrors a *distinct*
 * vanilla gladiator record, so each needs its own canonical resource bag, and
 * with one template per team there was nowhere to put the second one. The
 * adapter's answer was to declare no resources at all on those slots and
 * report `diagnostics.aiFillResourceGaps`, because guessing which template won
 * would have put an invented number inside `combatStateHash` — which is the one
 * thing that hash exists to prevent.
 *
 * A slot's fill source is therefore assembled from up to two declarations,
 * merged shallowly with the one nearest the slot winning:
 *
 * | Declaration | Shape | Applies to |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `team.aiFill` as an object | `{ ...combatantFields }` | every filled slot on the team |
 * | `team.aiFill` as an array | `[template, ...]`, indexed by slot | the slot at that index |
 * | the empty-slot marker | `{ fill: "ai", ...combatantFields }` | that one slot |
 *
 * The two `aiFill` forms are mutually exclusive by type; the marker's own
 * fields override whichever applied. `{ fill: "ai" }` and `{ empty: true }`
 * carry no fields and so mean exactly what they always did, which is what keeps
 * every existing blueprint byte-identical: a team declaring a single object
 * template and bare markers resolves to `{ ...template }` for every filled
 * slot, as before.
 *
 * The merge is shallow, exactly as the single-template spread always was: a
 * marker's `stats` replaces the team template's `stats` rather than merging
 * into it.
 *
 * Four things are refused rather than dropped in silence, because a fill field
 * that vanishes is how an AI ally ends up fighting as somebody else:
 *
 * 1. **A function.** `aiFill: (index) => template` was the obvious third
 *    option and it is unsound here. A blueprint has to survive a JSON round
 *    trip — `replayTeamBattle` takes one, so does every wire transfer and every
 *    saved battle — and a function does not, so a replayed blueprint would
 *    quietly build a *different* roster from the one that was hashed. The array
 *    form is the serialisable equivalent. (Today a function is not even inert:
 *    `template.name` reads the function's own `name`, so `aiFill: () => ...`
 *    names the fighter after the property it was assigned to.)
 * 2. **A scalar.** `aiFill: 42` spread to nothing and filled with defaults.
 * 3. **An array longer than the team's slot count.** A template addressed to a
 *    slot that cannot exist can never be used. An entry addressed to a slot
 *    that exists but happens to be *occupied* is deliberately allowed: "what
 *    each seat would be if empty" is a legitimate declaration.
 * 4. **`controller` on a fill template or marker.** It is the one key that is
 *    read for a supplied combatant and ignored for a filled one, so accepting
 *    it silently would be the exact asymmetry this module should not have. A
 *    filled slot's seat goes to the AI by construction; `reassignController`
 *    hands it to anyone else, mid-battle, without touching combat state.
 *
 * None of this consumes the RNG channel, and none of it is order-dependent: the
 * fill stays pure, so team size still never perturbs a replay.
