/**
 * Canonical resources: the resolver's one open, clamped, hashed numeric bag.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Before this module the only combat number the resolver carried was
 * `health`. A rule set could therefore be handed nothing else, and a rule set
 * that needed something else — SS2's `armourclass`, `staminaleft`,
 * `ammo_left`, `charisma`, the armour piece ratings — had to reach around the
 * seam and close over a side channel. That is not merely inconvenient: it is
 * unsound. `combatStateHash` covers what the resolver projects, so a value a
 * rule set reads through a side channel is a value the hash cannot see, and
 * two peers who disagree about it hash *identically* right up to the moment
 * they diverge. The hash's only job is to catch that, so a side channel turns
 * the desync check into a lie.
 *
 * The invariant this module exists to restore, and which
 * `test/team-resolver.test.js` pins:
 *
 * > **Everything a rule set can see, the projection carries — and therefore
 * > the hash covers.** The view is a strict subset of the projection.
 *
 * ## What qualifies as a resource
 *
 * A value belongs in `resources` if and only if **a rule set needs to read it
 * and the resolver must not interpret it**. The resolver stores it, clamps it,
 * projects it, and applies absolute `resource` effects to it. It never derives
 * one, never defaults one into existence, and never attaches meaning to a
 * name.
 *
 * Four constraints are what keep that from becoming an untyped grab-bag, and
 * they are enforced here rather than documented and hoped for:
 *
 * 1. **Numbers only.** A resource is a finite scalar. Not a string, not a
 *    boolean, not a nested structure. Anything that needs to be a flag is
 *    already served by `status`, which the resolver treats as an opaque
 *    string; anything that needs structure is the rule set's own static
 *    configuration and is not per-combatant battle state at all.
 * 2. **Declared at construction.** A combatant's resource *names* are fixed
 *    when the roster builds it. A rule set cannot conjure one mid-battle,
 *    because a resource that exists only on the branch one peer happened to
 *    take is a desync with a delay fuse.
 * 3. **Sorted.** The bag's key order is normalised, because the hash is
 *    `JSON.stringify` of the projection and object key order is insertion
 *    order. Two peers building the same bag from differently-ordered literals
 *    must not hash differently.
 * 4. **Written only through effects.** The rule set never holds live state; it
 *    returns `{ kind: "resource", targetId, resource, to }` and the resolver
 *    performs and clamps the write, exactly as it already does for damage and
 *    healing.
 *
 * ## Where the game-agnostic line actually falls
 *
 * The resolver learns no SS2 name from any of this. It learns one concept —
 * "clamped numeric pool" — and every name (`armourclass`, `staminaleft`) is
 * supplied by the blueprint, precisely the way the *values* of `stats` already
 * are. That is the argument for the generic `resource` effect over a bespoke
 * `armour` one: a bespoke kind would put an SS2 noun inside the resolver and
 * would need a sibling for stamina, another for ammunition, and another for
 * every resource a future rule set invents.
 *
 * ## Bounds are a rail, not a rule
 *
 * `min` defaults to 0 and `max` defaults to `null` (unbounded). Both must be
 * finite or `null` so the projection stays JSON-safe. They exist to stop a
 * pool going somewhere structurally impossible, **not** to express a game
 * rule: a maximum that itself moves during a battle is modelled as its own
 * resource, exactly as vanilla models `armourclass_max`, `staminamax` and
 * `maximum_ammo` as fields alongside the pools they bound.
 *
 * `health` is deliberately *not* a resource. It is the one number the resolver
 * does interpret (`alive = health > 0`), it already has effects and clamping
 * of its own, and two ways to write it would be two ways to disagree about it.
 * Its name is reserved below.

  //   declaration was the ONE path into the bag that never clamped: `-250`
  //   constructed as `{ value: -250, min: 0 }`, a value below its own declared
