/**
 * The campaign team-battle record: what a completed team battle persists.
 *
 * The record is the separate, additive artefact the roadmap's Stage 5
 * constraint asks for. It is produced by, and only by, a settlement that has
 * already passed both of `src/team/settlement.js`'s gates — a whole team down
 * *and* the final animation acknowledged — so one battle yields exactly one
 * record, and a knockout yields none.
 *
 * House style is deliberately the same as `src/golden/observation.js` and
 * `src/golden/promote-1v1-golden.js`: exact-key validation, an explicit schema
 * version, a canonical-JSON SHA-256 digest, and refusal rather than coercion.
 * A record that does not validate is not repaired; it is rejected, and the
 * reader in `store.js` degrades to "no campaign data" around it.
 *
 * ## What is in the record, and why
 *
 * | Block | Why it is here |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `settlement` | the record exists because settlement fired. `completionToken` is `<outcome>:<battle discriminator>` — a pure function of the outcome **of one battle** (`src/team/settlement.js`) — so it is the natural idempotency key, and its outcome half is recomputed here as a consistency check. Two bouts between the same teams ending the same way no longer share a token, and therefore no longer share a `recordId`. |
 * | `teams` | the roster: team ids, slot seats, and **which slots were AI-filled**. `aiFilled` is a roster fact — the slot had nobody in it — and is not the same question as whether a seat's controller is the AI. |
 * | `seats` | controller identity, kept in its own block exactly as `toControllerState()` keeps it out of `toTeamWireState()`. A seat entry may not carry a combatant id; the validator says so by name. |
 * | `outcomes` | per-combatant results: survival, final health, statuses, and the event sequence at which the combatant was defeated. |
 * | `provenance.ruleSet` | which rule set produced this battle **and whether it was runtime-verified or a placeholder**. A campaign built on placeholder maths has to stay identifiable, so this block is mandatory and its verified claim is gated the same way `src/team/rule-set.js` gates it. |
 * | `provenance.battle` | seed, state version, initiative, turn count, RNG cursor, and the controller-independent combat state hash, so a record can later be tied to a replay. |
 * | `provenance.writer` | which build of this layer wrote the record. |
 * | `provenance.migration` | null for a natively written record; populated, with the pre-migration digest, for one that was upgraded. |
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not in it
 *
 * Combatant **stat blocks**. `strength`, `attack`, `vitality`, `stamina` and
 * `magicka` are vanilla field names, so `assertNoVanillaFieldNames()` would
 * refuse a record carrying them — and that refusal is correct. A battle record
 * is an outcome record, not a character sheet. The character sheet is
 * vanilla's, and this layer neither copies it nor competes with it.
 *
 * Also absent: any formula, any threshold, and any combat decision. Every
 * number in a record was decided and clamped by the resolver running an
 * injected rule set. This module copies; it never computes an outcome.
