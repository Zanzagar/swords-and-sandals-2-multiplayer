/**
 * The data boundary between this layer and the vanilla SS2 save.
 *
 * The roadmap's Stage 5 constraint is one sentence: "Campaign saves add a
 * separate team-battle record and migration version; they do not overwrite
 * vanilla save fields while the adapter is experimental." This module is the
 * mechanism that makes the second half true by construction rather than by
 * care.
 *
 * ## Why the boundary has to be structural
 *
 * The vanilla save is not a file this project owns. `docs/integration/
 * ss2-arena-route.md` §8 records that root frame 150 calls
 * `save_character(_global.current_character)` on **every** entry to the town
 * square, which re-derives the hero, writes `so_local["character" + char_no]`
 * and flushes `SharedObject.getLocal("ss2_data")`. A leveled-gladiator route
 * therefore rewrites gold, experience, level, equipment and the battle
 * counters at least twice per fight loop, and the capture protocol's install
 * hash attests the SWF, not the SharedObject. The vanilla save is live,
 * mutable state that changes under us between sessions and that we cannot
 * fully predict. Anything we write into it we would be racing.
 *
 * So this layer is strictly additive. It records *alongside* the vanilla save,
 * never inside it, and it degrades to "no campaign data" rather than reaching
 * for a vanilla field to reconstruct itself.
 *
 * ## Three defences, in order of strength
 *
 * 1. **No API in `src/campaign/` accepts a vanilla object.** There is no read
 *    path, no write path, and no field mapping for `_root.game.hero`,
 *    `so_local`, or `ss2_data` anywhere in this directory. The illegal write
 *    has no function to call. (Compare `src/adapter/`, which *does* map the
 *    vanilla surface — that is the adapter's job and not this layer's.)
 * 2. **Every storage key is minted here.** `campaignKey()` is the only key
 *    constructor, every key it mints begins `ss2TeamArena:`, and the store
 *    re-checks the prefix at its single choke point. Vanilla's own save keys
 *    (`character1`, `max_gladiators`, …) contain no colon, so a minted key
 *    cannot collide with one even by accident.
 * 3. **Every payload is screened by name.** `assertNoVanillaFieldNames()`
 *    walks the whole record and refuses it if *any* object key anywhere in it
 *    is a name the vanilla surface uses. The catalogue is imported from
 *    `src/adapter/vanilla-fields.js` rather than copied, so the screen grows
 *    automatically as the map is extended.
 *
 * Defence 3 has a side effect that is deliberate: a campaign record cannot
 * carry a combatant's stat block, because `strength`, `attack`, `vitality`,
 * `stamina` and `magicka` are vanilla field names. That is the right answer.
 * A battle record is an outcome record, not a character sheet; the character
 * sheet belongs to vanilla and duplicating it here is exactly the coupling the
 * boundary exists to prevent.
