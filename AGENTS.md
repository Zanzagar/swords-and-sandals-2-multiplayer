# AGENTS.md — Swords & Sandals II multiplayer foundation

Rules every agent working in this repository must follow, whichever tool it is
running under. **Claude Code loads this through the one-line `CLAUDE.md`; Codex
loads it directly.** Keep it SELF-CONTAINED: Codex has no `@import` mechanism, so
a reference here is a pointer a human follows, never an include.

**Keep this file short.** It is loaded into every session of every agent, so
every line is paid for on every turn. Anything that only some sessions need
belongs behind a pointer, not in here.

## What this project is

It reverse-engineers a licensed Flash game to build **runtime-verified** test
fixtures. The entire value of the corpus is that its numbers were measured, not
asserted. Almost every rule below exists to stop an agent quietly converting
measured evidence into self-confirming data.

## Start here

**Read the newest file in `docs/handoffs/` before doing anything else**, then
**`HANDOFF.md`'s LIVING HEAD** for accumulated state — everything above the
`## THE ARCHIVE LINE` heading. Below that line is frozen evidence and history:
read it to check a claim, never to learn what is current, and never append there.

`HANDOFF.md` is long and is deliberately NOT imported here — open it, do not
expect it in context.

**The living head is the ONLY place a wrong instruction may be corrected**, and
corrections go AT the instruction, not only in a block above it. A handoff under
`docs/handoffs/` freezes when its session ends, so a correction that lives only
there never reaches the next reader.

## Non-negotiable

- **Never hand-write a golden, an observation or a manifest.** A candidate
  becomes golden ONLY via >=2 matching observations from >=2 independent capture
  sessions, through the pipeline.
- **Derive candidates from the battle map, never from a capture.** When a fixture
  disagrees with the runtime, re-derive it from the map. Do NOT edit the fixture
  to the observed value. This is the single most tempting wrong move here.
- **BUILD THE BEST VERSION OF THE GAME. Nothing here forbids that, and this
  block used to read as though it did.** New art, new UI, new systems, a new
  progression curve, new opponents, new screens — all yours, all unblocked, all
  shippable. If a rule ever seems to stand between you and a better game, it is
  either miscalibrated or misread; say so and it gets fixed. Owner, 2026-09-02:
  *"We want to create the BEST version of the game we can. If we need to dial
  things back later we note that and do it when we have to."*
- **Two narrow operational facts remain, and NEITHER is an ethics boundary:**
  1. **The installed SWF stays byte-identical, because it is the MEASUREMENT
     ORACLE.** All 23 promoted goldens, 70 observation records and every capture
     manifest cite its sha256. Change the install by one byte and the corpus
     stops describing anything — not a licence problem, an evidence problem.
     **When modding the build becomes the work, put the modded copy in a SECOND
     install with its own fingerprint lane.** That costs a directory and keeps
     both.
  2. **Ship no SS2 asset.** The project is intended to be shared, so the repo is
     a distribution channel: someone who clones it must still need their own
     licensed copy to play. Same model as a Doom source port shipping no WAD.
     This is about what leaves the repo, never about what you may build in it.
     Never distributed FOR PROFIT.
- **Never shortcut the game's own frames.** Skipping the prologue tripped the
  game's own character-tampering screen.
- `validate-vehicle.ps1` must PASS after ANY wrapper edit — but read what it does
  not prove. It caught 0 of the 6 defects found live on this route.
- **Snapshot before every save-mutating run.** `run-arena.ps1` does it for you.
- **Git and GitHub: follow `claude-harness/docs/git-hygiene.md`** — thirteen
  rules on branches, commits, pushing, PRs and merge eligibility. They are
  repository policy for Claude, Codex and humans, but enforcement is
  actor-specific: a branch's `.claude/settings.json` mediates Claude Code only;
  Codex permissions and a human shell are separate. Never claim one tool's
  settings enforce another actor.
  **This project TIGHTENS rule 7 (push feature branches freely) to ASK BEFORE
  EVERY PUSH**, because the fixtures derive from a licensed game and what
  leaves this machine is the owner's call. `main` is denied outright.

## If you are a subagent

Claude Code loads this file into subagents too (all except the built-in Explore
and Plan agents), so these rules bind you as well:

- **No agent launches Ruffle**, touches the installation, the save or the
  snapshots, or runs a state-mutating git command. Those are the main session's,
  serial and supervised.
- **Adversarial verifiers write nothing at all.** In the rare audit permitted
  below, give each verifier one named claim and stay inside the committed cap.
- **Treat every fact in your brief as a hypothesis** — tables, counts and quoted
  file contents included. Re-derive anything you rely on. A premise that turns
  out to be wrong is a finding that outranks the task, and must be reported
  prominently rather than worked around.
- **Never relay a number, table or quotation you have not re-derived yourself.**
  Hand over the source (file, offsets, command), not the conclusion.

## Multi-agent runs

Standing rules to paste into every agent prompt are in
`docs/overnight-agent-plan.md` — **ABOVE its `## THE ARCHIVE LINE` only**;
below that line is the frozen record of two runs in August, not guidance. A
branch that carries `.claude/workflows/` has the Claude-only runnable form;
absence is not permission to recreate it inline. *(This pointer used to name
the whole file, which is how a plan written for ONE night in August became
doctrine loaded by every agent. See that file's own header for what the
omission cost.)*

- **PRECEDENCE, decided by the owner 2026-09-02 (harness `docs/adr/0001`):
  Pocock's decision discipline is the default workflow, Codex adversarial
  review is the check on any diff that matters, and a fan-out wave is the LAST
  resort — only for breaking a claim about the game's bytes or the capture
  archive that no test pins and no diff review reaches. ONE wave at a time,
  never concurrent; the committed script hard-caps questions and verifiers at
  6 each, and authoring an inline workflow to get past that is a rule
  violation. Say what a wave will spawn BEFORE launching it. Three concurrent
  12-verifier waves spent ~30% of a week's usage in twenty minutes.**
- **Fan out on QUESTIONS, not replicas.** Measured here 2026-08-31: two
  independent implementations agreed on every number and were both incomplete in
  the same way, because they shared one brief that carried one wrong fact. The
  agent that overturned the result was the one aimed at a different question.
  Agreement between agents given the same brief is weak evidence — the brief is
  the correlated failure mode. Ask "what were they all told?"
- **Verifiers write nothing and get ONE named claim each.**
- **Assert `started == briefs`.** A wave that silently spawns nothing returns
  fast, which otherwise reads as success.
- **A wave with dead verifiers is UNVERIFIED, not complete.** Never report
  confident unverified findings; check per-agent state, not the run's status.

## Code review (Codex)

- **Codex adversarial review is FLAG-ONLY and on demand**
  (`/codex:adversarial-review`), for high-stakes diffs: auth, data loss,
  concurrency, save/persistence, protocol changes. Its findings are CLAIMS TO
  VERIFY — never auto-apply them.
- **The stop-time review gate stays DISABLED by design.** `reviewGateEnabled:
  false` is CORRECT — do not "fix" it. Arming it creates Claude/Codex loops that
  drain both subscriptions, and the only controlled study of Codex reviewing
  Claude found harm precisely when reviewer output was auto-adopted (audit
  2026-08-31).
- Codex is worth having here because it is INDEPENDENT: it deliberately does not
  share Claude's `code-review` skill, so the two do not correlate as reviewers.

## Skills

Installed skills are invoked on judgment; there is no forced-invocation rule.
Provenance for the shared rules and workflows is the `claude-harness` repo.

For dedicated Endless progression design, use the repo-local
`$ss2-progression-design` skill. It adapts Pocock's decision-tree/frontier
discipline to the existing owner packet and decision record; it does not
replace them with issue tickets and does not apply to vanilla evidence work.

## Running the tests

There are no dependencies to install. From the repo root, with node >= 26:

```
node --test --test-concurrency=1
```

Use `--test-concurrency=1`: the machine is memory-starved with many agents, and
parallel spawns intermittently fail with `spawn UNKNOWN`, which is not a code
failure.

**IF `node` IS NOT ON PATH, WORK OUT WHICH ENVIRONMENT YOU ARE IN BEFORE
REACHING FOR A FIX — the two remedies are not interchangeable and the wrong one
is a syntax error, not a fallback.**

**In WSL/Linux, a missing `node` means your environment was SCRUBBED** — cron, a
hook, a systemd unit, or `wsl -- bash -c` driven from Windows. node comes from
nvm, which puts it on PATH; an ordinary agent session inherits that PATH and
`bash -c` and `bash -lc` both find node with no help. Only a wiped environment
loses it. Then, and only then:

```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"; . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

Use `bash -ic` when testing shell FUNCTIONS (`opus5`, `fable5`, `sol`) — those
come from `~/.bashrc`, which does return early for non-interactive shells.

*(Corrected 2026-08-31 after the first WSL session measured it. An earlier
version of this paragraph blamed `.bashrc`'s non-interactive early return and
told every session to source nvm. That was generalised from one unusual caller —
WSL driven from Windows — and would have cost every session a step it does not
need. The early return is real but is not what puts node on PATH.)*

**In a Windows-native session** (PowerShell, and only there) node genuinely is
absent, npm too. Use the codex runtime's node — resolve it rather than pinning
it, as the directory moves on update:

```
& 'C:\Users\corey\.cache\codex-runtimes\codex-primary-runtime\dependencies\node\bin\node.exe' --test --test-concurrency=1
```

That line is PowerShell. **Do not run it in WSL — it is a bash syntax error**,
and the path is unreachable from Linux anyway.

**Two test profiles are correct, and which one you get depends on the tree:**

- A capture-bearing tree, holding at least one probe session directory under
  the gitignored `captures/` archive: **all tests pass, 0 skipped.** (The
  directory merely existing is not enough — it is committed, holding a manifest
  and a README — so a tree with `captures/` and 1 skipped is CORRECT.)
- A fresh clone or worktree without that archive: **1 skipped**, and the skip is
  the raw-trace archive existence check. This is EXPECTED, not a defect.

**Otherwise a skipped test is a real finding, not noise.** Expect the exact count
the newest handoff states; if you measure a different number, say so rather than
carrying the old one forward. The archive check is anchored so that a broken path
derivation FAILS and names itself rather than skipping silently.

## Conventions

- Use `git commit -F <file>` for any message containing quotes — PowerShell
  mangles them otherwise.
- **`gh` IS installed and authenticated in WSL** (2.98.0, account `Zanzagar`), at
  `~/.local/bin/gh`. It is NOT installed on Windows — there, check PR state with
  `git ls-remote github "refs/pull/*/head"`, which works everywhere.
- **Flag your own mistakes prominently in the repo's own record** rather than
  quietly fixing them. Commit messages here name which errors were whose.
- End a working session by writing a date-stamped brief to `docs/handoffs/`
  carrying its `sessionId`, so the next session starts from one sentence.
