.SYNOPSIS
Run one capture session start to finish with no human input and no cursor.

The wrapper navigates the game from its title screen to the target battle
using the game's own navigation calls, performs the battle actions through
the same entry point its buttons call, closes its own trace, and this script
then closes the window so the launcher's delog/ingest/verify pipeline runs.

Nothing here touches the mouse, the keyboard, or the foreground window, so
runs are safe to leave going while the machine is used for something else.

# -WatchFields is a comma list of ActionScript identifiers and nothing else,
# and it is checked HERE, before anything is launched, because the way it fails
# without the check is silent.
#
# The comma is safe either way, and that is worth stating so nobody adds
# quoting for the wrong reason: `powershell -File` passes each argument through
# as a literal string, so `-WatchFields a,b` binds the single string "a,b" and
# is NOT parsed as an array. Measured on this host (PS 5.1) with this script's
# exact argument array: the eleven-name champion list arrives byte-identical
# quoted and unquoted, as do ';', '$', '@' and a backtick.
#
# A SPACE is not safe. Start-Process joins -ArgumentList with plain spaces and
# adds no quoting of its own, so the tail of an unquoted value becomes its own
# token and binds POSITIONALLY to the first unbound parameter of
# launch-capture.ps1 - which is -AttackerSide. Measured, same argument array:
#
#   -WatchFields boot_defence villain  ->  $WatchFields  = "boot_defence"
#                                          $AttackerSide = "villain"
#                                          exit 0, nothing on stderr
#
# That is the trace's entire attacker label, rewritten by a typo, with the
# watch list silently truncated in the same stroke, and no error anywhere. The
# natural human spelling "boot_defence, weapon" fails differently and no less
# confusingly: a ValidateSet error naming -AttackerSide, a parameter this
# script never passes.
#
# So the value is BOTH quoted below (like every other string forward, and like
# run-arena.ps1 already does) and refused here. Quoting alone would only move
# the corruption one hop: launch-capture.ps1 builds "-PwatchFields=$WatchFields"
# into its own Start-Process array and joins that with plain spaces too. And a
# space could not do anything useful even if it arrived - the wrapper parses
# with `rawWatchFields.split(",")` and does not trim, so " weapon" matches no
# field name Object.watch could bind. Nothing legitimate is refused: no field
# the wrapper can watch contains whitespace or a quote.
