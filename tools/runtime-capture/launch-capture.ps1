<#
.SYNOPSIS
Launch one controlled licensed capture session.

Verifies the installed hashes, rebuilds the wrapper from source, injects the
target fixture's tape, and opens the licensed game (read in place via a
file: URL — never copied) inside the instrumented wrapper under portable
Ruffle.

With -Autopilot and -Navigate set (which every automated caller does), the
session needs no human input at all: the wrapper navigates the menus with the
game own calls, the autopilot performs the action through the same entry point
the on-screen buttons call, and the trace closes itself. No cursor, no window
focus, no clicking. Leave -Autopilot empty only if you deliberately want to
play the fight by hand.

The script then extracts the trace and runs ingest (with the live post-session
hash check) and verify automatically.
