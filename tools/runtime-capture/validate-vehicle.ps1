.SYNOPSIS
One-command capture-vehicle validation gate.

Rebuilds the wrapper and the structural stub game from source, runs the
wrapper against the stub under portable Ruffle with the target fixture's
tape injected, then delogs, ingests (which performs the live post-session
install-hash check), and verifies the observation against the fixture.
Exits 0 only when the round trip MATCHES.

Run this after every wrapper edit and before trusting any real capture.
Traces produced here are validation artifacts (ids prefixed stubcheck-);
never place their observation records under test/observations/.

The run is isolated from the licensed save. Ruffle gets its own empty
--save-directory under captures\vehicle-check\ (throwaway, like every other
artifact in that directory), EVERY .sol under the shared Ruffle save root
(three of them on this machine, not just ss2_data.sol) is hashed before and
after, and the gate refuses to start while any other Ruffle window is open.
That before/after check is a tripwire the stub cannot currently trip - see
the PASS text at the bottom for exactly what it does and does not establish.

None of the isolation was here originally: the gate ran at the real
SharedObject root with no process guard, which is a poor property for the one
script the project mandates running most often.

# Read-only. Descended from Get-SaveState in run-arena.ps1: the size and hash of
# the shared Ruffle SharedObject root's contents, or ABSENT when there are none.
# ABSENT is a legitimate state (a machine that has never run the game), and
# ABSENT before and after is a pass - the assertion is that this gate CHANGED
# nothing, not that a save exists.
#
# EVERY .sol under the root, not the first file named ss2_data.sol. The narrow
# version read as "the licensed save is untouched" and meant "one of the files
# in the shared store is untouched": this machine's root holds three .sol files
# (localhost\probe_b.sol, the ss2_data.sol under the Steam swf key, and
# localhost\...\captures\wrapper\probe.swf\probe_a.sol), so two thirds of the
# store it claims to watch were unwatched, and a wrapper that wrote a NEW
# SharedObject under a new key - which is exactly the future this tripwire
# exists to catch - would have been invisible to it. Whole-tree also means a
# file appearing or disappearing changes the string, not just a file's contents
# changing.
#
# Widening does not ARM it; see the PASS text at the bottom of this script.
#
# Extension test rather than -Filter '*.sol'. The FileSystem provider's -Filter
# is a Win32 wildcard, not a suffix test, and it OVER-matches - measured on this
# machine, in a scratch directory holding a.sol, b.SOL, c.solx, d.sol.bak, e.so
# and longnamethatis.solid, `-Filter '*.sol'` returned a.sol, b.SOL, c.solx AND
# longnamethatis.solid, while `Where-Object { $_.Extension -eq '.sol' }` returned
# exactly a.sol and b.SOL. -eq is case-insensitive, which is what NTFS is. (The
# narrow version used -Filter 'ss2_data.sol', a literal with no wildcard, so this
# is a hazard the widening introduces rather than one it inherits.) An
# over-matching filter would not make the tripwire unsafe - it would watch MORE -
# but "every .sol under the root" has to be true in both directions or the check
# again means something other than what it reads as meaning.
#
# Sorted so the before/after strings are order-stable; the relative path is
# carried in the string so a rename inside the root is a change like any other.

# shared store by necessity, and it refuses to START while any Ruffle window is
# open. This is the other half of that refusal - without it, the gate is the one
# script in the repository that can walk into a supervised save-mutating route.
#
# (run-arena.ps1 used to key its own bookkeeping on the process NAME, so a
# stub-check window would also have satisfied its wait, masked the real
# window's death, and been killed mid-check by its blanket kill. That is fixed -
# it now waits on, polls and closes its own pid from captures\<SessionId>\

# observed to land there, but this is the script the project mandates running
# after EVERY wrapper edit - i.e. the one most likely to be pointed at a
# wrapper that has just started writing something new. Isolation makes "the
