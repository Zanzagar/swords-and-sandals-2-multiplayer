/**
 * SS2 runtime-capture wrapper (ActionScript 2, AVM1).
 *
 * Independently authored instrumentation host for controlled 1v1 capture
 * sessions against the licensed Swords & Sandals II SWF identified in
 * docs/integration/ss2-build-fingerprint.json. It loads the installed file in
 * place (never a copy), never patches it, and emits only the JSONL trace
 * grammar from docs/integration/ss2-runtime-capture.md via trace().
 *
 * Capture model (single action): the wrapper hooks the battle controller at
 * _root.arena.gladiators.overlay (byte-verified instance path) and ARMS on
 * the first checkattackroll invocation: it dumps both combatants' state at
 * that instant, records every randomBetween roll and watched-field mutation
 * that happens inside that call (which per the byte-verified map includes
 * damagecharacter, armour removal, death, knockback, and enchantment), and
 * closes the trace automatically when the call returns. Rolls and mutations
 * outside the armed action (AI decision rolls, battlevalues churn, later
 * turns) are deliberately not part of the capture. Pressing END is only a
 * manual fallback for closing a trace early.
 *
 * The overlay timeline re-executes its frame-52 DoAction as the battle state
 * machine loops, which REASSIGNS the combat functions; every wrap is
 * therefore installed resiliently via Object.watch on the function slot so
 * vanilla's re-definitions get re-wrapped at assignment time (validated the
 * hard way: the first live session lost its hooks to exactly this).
 *
 * Runtime configuration arrives via FlashVars / loader query string — the
 * install path and session identity are never embedded in this file:
 *   gameUrl        file: URL of the installed swords_sandals2_download.swf
 *   observationId  token
 *   sessionId      token
 *   toolVersion    e.g. ss2-capture/0.1.0
 *   observedAt     ISO timestamp recorded by the operator
 *   hashBefore     "true" only after tools/capture-session.mjs verify-install
 *   attackerSide   "hero" (default) or "villain"
 *   injected       "true" => serve the fixture tape from randomBetween
 *   tape           comma list label:min:max:value in fixture order —
 *                  randomBetween samples ONLY, consumed exclusively inside
 *                  the armed action
 *   watchFields    comma list of game-object fields to watch (defaults below)
 *   navigate       "prisoner" — the staged tutorial fight (stepNavigator), or
 *                  "arena" — the leveled-gladiator route (stepArenaNavigator)
 *   arenaTarget    "level:<n>" drive duels until herolevel reaches n, or
 *                  "tournament" enter the ladder and fight it to rank 1
 *   arenaPolicy    "aggressive" — the arena route's fight policy; the prisoner
 *                  route keeps its explicit autopilot step list instead
 *   arenaCapture   "never" (default) | "champion" | "always" — which bout of a
 *                  multi-bout arena run may be recorded
 *   timeOfDayCeiling, sessionLimitSec
 *                  arena-route abort bounds; see GATE A
 *
 * FlashVars land as _root properties and timeline vars ARE _root properties,
 * so every FlashVar is read before any same-named variable is declared.
 *
 * The post-session hash attestation is NOT a launch parameter: the wrapper
 * emits the end line with a null placeholder, and capture-session.mjs ingest
 * re-runs the install hash check live and stamps the attestation only when
 * it passes.

// ► **WHERE THE RECORDING WINDOW CLOSES, AND WHY IT IS A PARAMETER RATHER THAN
//   A CHANGE.** By default `finishTrace` fires on `checkattackroll`'s RETURN,
//   so the window is exactly that call. That boundary is deliberate — it
//   matches the single-action fixture scope, and the `nextphase` hook closes
//   before its stamina and regen accounting for the same reason.
//
//   **It also makes some of the build unobservable.** `psyche_up`'s counter is
//   written at `+0x6738` (the discharge writing itself back to 1) and at
//   `+0x6761` (the animation callback adding one), and BOTH execute after
//   `checkattackroll` has returned. `docs/integration/ss2-capture-staging.md`
//   says "two consecutive presses recorded live decide it"; with this window
//   they decide nothing, because neither write is inside it.
//
//   `traceWindow=phase` defers the close to the `nextphase` boundary, which the
//   hook below already recognises, so everything the phase does after the roll
//   lands inside the armed window.
//
// ► **THE DEFAULT IS UNCHANGED AND MUST STAY THAT WAY.** All 69 observation
//   records and every archived manifest were taken with the action window. A
//   wider trace carries MORE lines by construction, so a run in one mode is not
//   comparable with a run in the other, and the `end` line says which mode it
//   was — but only when it is not the default, so every ordinary trace stays
//   byte-comparable with the archive exactly as the staged fields do.

// Arena navigator (navigate=arena): the LEVELED-gladiator route.
//
// stepNavigator above is a one-shot linear walk to a single staged fight.
// This route LOOPS - town square -> foyer -> fight -> reward -> (level up) ->
// town square - so it is written as a state machine over the screen the game
// is actually resting on, and re-entering a screen is ordinary rather than a
// special case. Mapped in docs/integration/ss2-arena-route.md; every action
// below names the DefineButton2 whose body it replicates statement for
// statement, so the two can be diffed.
//
// This is the first thing this project runs that can permanently change the
// licensed save: root frame 150 calls save_character() and flushes the
// SharedObject on EVERY town-square entry (route map section 8). Four hazards
// an adversarial audit found are therefore enforced here as hard gates,
// marked GATE A..D. None of them may be relaxed without new evidence.
//
//   GATE A  time_of_day advances on a 1.5s WALL-CLOCK setInterval during
//           everything except the battle. At >= 200 the game enters a special
//           event that permanently mutates charisma, magicka or gold and then
//           SAVES it through town square. Re-assert 24 at each town-square
//           rest (the write buttons 1669 and 2283 both make), log it, and
//           abort well below 200.
//   GATE B  root frames 160-169 are that special event. Reaching them at all
//           is a failed run: abort, never advance through them.
//   GATE C  button 2283 gates on the DISPLAY MIRROR _root.statpoints, kept by
//           an enterFrame clip action - not game.hero.statpoints. Pressing in
//           the same execution slot as the four decrements takes the refusal
//           arm and parks forever, so the press waits for the mirror to read
//           zero on a LATER frame.
//   GATE D  the daybreak wait must abort and log, never re-issue
//           gotoAndPlay("daybreak"). Re-entering the span mid-way retains the
//           existing day_night clip and can flip its parity to a permanent
//           hang.

// revision of this comment dropped the factor of two and invented the
// collection; the conclusion was right, the formula was not.)
// (root frame 35, battlevalues +0x3356 and +0x3386). So staging `min_damage`
// writes the OUTPUT of a formula the game recomputes from its inputs. Eleven
// staged fields were read back correctly at battle construction and changed
// nothing about the fight, because the number that matters is regenerated from
// `strength` and `hero.weapon`.
//
// Buying changes an INPUT. `hero.weapon` is persistent, survives every
// battlevalues call, every save and every relaunch - and the only thing this

// Scenario staging: writing combatant state before the first action.
//
// THIS IS THE FIRST THING THE WRAPPER DOES THAT AUTHORS GAME STATE, and it is a
// deliberate, owner-approved departure from how all twenty-two promoted goldens
// were captured. Until now the wrapper injected only the RNG tape and observed
// whatever the game produced. Read this before using it.
//
// Why it exists. Two remaining capture targets are unreachable without it:
//   - candidate-armoured-* stages exact per-piece values (helmet 6, greaves 2)
//     that randomise_gladiator will never hand us by chance;
//   - the tournament rank-1 opponent IS reproducible (verified live: "John the
//     Butcher", 110 hitpointsmax, 86 armourclass, identical across five
//     independent draws) but the HERO's state entering that bout is not -
//     staminaleft carries across bouts, and a mid-ladder level-up is decided by
//     a generated opponent's experience award. Both were observed varying.
//
// What it is and is not. A staged field is a scenario INPUT. The game still
// resolves the entire action: every roll, every dispatch, every mutation. The
// pipeline was already built expecting staged scenarios - ingest projects the
// observed scenario onto the fixture's staged fields and reports a mis-staged
// one as an explicit mismatch. So staging does not weaken a formula
// measurement. What it does weaken is any claim that the SCENARIO is one the
// game's own progression could reach, and that is why every staged field is
// reported on the end line rather than left for a reader to infer.
//
// Timing. Writes are applied only once `battle_started` is true - past root
// frame 214's full heal, past root frame 221's forced `equipped_weapon = 1`,
// and past initbattle - and repeated for a few frames, because the game
// re-derives values during battle construction and a single early write would
// be silently overwritten. They stop before the action arms, so no staged write
// can ever appear in the mutation trace: the watch callbacks emit only while
// armed, and beginAction's state dump is what records the staged values.
