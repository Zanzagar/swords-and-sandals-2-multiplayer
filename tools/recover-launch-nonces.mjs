/**
 * Report which committed observation records would gain a `capture.launchNonce`
 * if they were re-ingested from their archived raw trace.
 *
 * REPORT ONLY. This tool has no write path, deliberately.
 *
 * WHY NO --apply. `campaign.mjs ingest-round` refuses to overwrite a committed
 * observation ("refusing to overwrite committed evidence"), and that guard is
 * correct: a record is evidence, and silently rewriting evidence is the failure
 * this repository exists to prevent. Recovering a dropped nonce is a deliberate
 * corpus operation with a blast radius (every affected digest changes, and every
 * golden citing one must be re-promoted), so it belongs to a session that has
 * decided to do it, not to a tool that can do it by accident.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. Measured 2026-09-01: nothing in the repository can tell a
 * recovered nonce from an invented one. A verifier resealed one record's digest
 * with its true nonce, a fabricated nonce, a nonce stolen from another record,
 * and no nonce at all -- all four matched with zero differences and passed
 * `validateSs2Observation`, because `SS2_PAIRWISE_EXCLUDED_KEYS` excludes
 * `capture` wholesale. So the assurance cannot come from a check after the fact.
 * It has to come from the operation being REPRODUCIBLE: anyone can re-run this
 * against the archive and get the same tokens, or not.
 *
 * That is why the report prints the archive path, its own resolution rule, and a
 * per-record token. Re-run it and diff the output; a token that does not
 * reproduce was not recovered from a trace.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node tools/recover-launch-nonces.mjs --archive <dir> [--json]
 *
 * The archive lives outside the repo and its location is not derivable: this
 * clone's own `captures/` holds a README and nothing else. Three copies existed
 * on 2026-09-01 and they DISAGREED in file counts, so the path is required
 * rather than guessed, and it is echoed in the report.
