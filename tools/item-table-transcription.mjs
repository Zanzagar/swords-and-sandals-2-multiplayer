/**
 * Census: does `docs/integration/ss2-item-tables.md` still say what the build says?
 *
 * That document is a TRANSCRIPTION of build-constant data — 90 weapon entries,
 * each a six-element array literal in one run at
 * `root/frame:35/DoAction@0x3fa9dc`. It was recorded on 2026-08-30 by reading
 * the bytes, and for three days afterwards two other places in this repository
 * said the table "is not transcribed", so a ranked next step pointed at work
 * that was already done. The document is now load-bearing, and a hand-made
 * table nobody re-checks is exactly the artefact this project distrusts.
 *
 * REPORT ONLY. It reads the installed SWF and the committed document, and
 * writes nothing.
 *
 *   node tools/item-table-transcription.mjs
 *   node tools/item-table-transcription.mjs "/path/to/swords_sandals2_download.swf"
 *
 * Exit status is 0 when every row agrees, 1 when any row disagrees, 2 when the
 * SWF is not reachable. A fresh clone has no licensed build, so this is a tool
 * a human runs on the capture box rather than a test — the same shape as
 * `tools/stable-order-locale-census.mjs`.
 *
 * ## What it checks, and the part that is easy to miss
 *
 * Two independent things, because the first alone would not be worth much:
 *
 * 1. **The numbers.** Every field of every row, against the literal the
 *    document names, INCLUDING the instruction offset. A diff that skipped the
 *    offset would pass a document whose rows had been silently renumbered.
 *
 * 2. **The index convention.** Check 1 only proves the document's numbers are
 *    the build's numbers UNDER THE DOCUMENT'S OWN CONVENTION — it reads
 *    `[e, name, d, c, b, a]` out of `Push "weapon<N>", a, b, c, d, <name>, e`
 *    because the document says that is the order, so a wrong convention would
 *    be invisible to it. So the reader sites in `battlevalues` are checked
 *    too: `weapon_min_damage` really is index 3, `weapon_max_damage` index 4,
 *    and so on, read off the `Push <n>; GetMember` that follows each. THIS IS
 *    THE HALF THAT MAKES THE OTHER HALF MEAN ANYTHING, and it is the half a
 *    checker written in a hurry leaves out.
 *
 * ## Inspection boundary
 *
 * Display names are game content. The document does not reproduce them and
 * neither does this tool: index `[1]` is parsed only far enough to confirm a
 * string sits there, and its value is never printed or compared.

/**
 * WHICH END OF `weaponweights` IS HEAVY — the question the swing cost rests on.
 *
 * ► **THIS WAS CARRIED AS AN OPEN QUESTION FOR A DAY, RANKED FIRST, AND THE
 *   ANSWER WAS ALREADY IN THE DOCUMENT THIS TOOL CHECKS.**
 *   `MAP_SILENCE.swing-cost` said the array's "VALUES this repository does not
 *   hold", so `ss2WeaponMass`'s direction was marked AUTHORED and inferred from
 *   a damage correlation. `docs/integration/ss2-item-tables.md` states it
 *   outright two lines under the offset the silence entry cites for the
 *   LOCATION — and has since `df3a122`, 2026-08-30. **Third instance of one
 *   failure: declaring the map silent without reading the surrounding
 *   paragraph.** The inference happened to be right, which is the least
 *   reassuring way for it to end.
 *
 * WHAT IS CHECKED, and why it is a direction rather than a transcription.
 * `weaponweights` holds six STRINGS — human-readable weight classes, so
 * `attack_speed` is a weight-CLASS index and never a numeric speed. This tool
 * asserts the SHAPE (six entries, index 0 the empty pad) and the DIRECTION
 * (index 1 is the heavy end, index 5 the light one) by substring, and
 * reproduces no entry. That answers the only question the engine asks of it
 * while keeping the licensing boundary §2.1 sets for the weapon names.
 *
 * The array is built by `NewObject`, which pops the class name, then the count,
 * then the arguments — so the compiler pushes them in REVERSE and the array is
 * the reverse of the push order. That convention is not assumed here: it is
 * confirmed against `weapontypes`, whose reversed form the document pins AND
 * which §2.2 cross-checks from the 90 rows' own `[0]` values.
