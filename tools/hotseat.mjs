/**
 * Hot-seat runner: the first thing in this repository a person can PLAY, and
 * since this change the first that plays SS2's OWN arithmetic.
 *
 * Two humans take turns at one keyboard. It drives `src/team/` directly and
 * touches `src/adapter/` not at all — the adapter's canonical resource bag
 * cannot carry an SS2 rule set's inputs (see `src/team/ss2-rules.js`). Node
 * builtins only; `package.json` has no dependencies and this must not add one.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The resolver, the roster, the RNG channel, elimination and
 * settlement had all been tested for months and never once been played, and a
 * corpus of 22 runtime-verified goldens fed nothing. Until a person can watch a
 * fight, no measurement has a consumer and no priority has a source.
 *
 * IT DECIDES NO COMBAT. Every number on screen was decided and clamped by the
 * resolver running the INJECTED RULE SET. There is no formula here — the only
 * arithmetic below is array indexing and column widths. That is the same
 * boundary `src/adapter/` keeps, and for the same reason: a runner that quietly
 * did its own damage would make the rule set unfalsifiable.
 *
 * ON HONESTY. The banner names the rule set's verification tier on every run
 * and refuses to be subtle about it. `map-derived` is NOT `runtime-verified`,
 * and the banner says which parts of the fight have golden backing and which
 * have none. That confusion is the exact failure this whole project is built to
 * prevent, and a playable demo is the easiest place in the world to commit it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/hotseat.mjs [--rules ss2|placeholder] [--seed <n>]
 *                          [--hp <n>] [--armour <n>] [--enchant <cond>[:<pot>]]
 *                          [--names A,B]

  --seed <n>     RNG seed; the same seed and the same choices replay exactly
  --hp <n>       starting health for both fighters (default 60). In the build
                 this is DERIVED (herolevel * 10 + vitality * 20) and would be
                 recomputed by battlevalues; here it is staged directly.
  --enchant <condition>[:<potency>]
                 arm BOTH fighters with an enchanted weapon, so hits can
                 inflict a condition: burning, frozen, poison or life_stolen,
                 potency 1-3 (default 3 — the strongest grade the magic shop
                 sells). A condition then TAKES ITS BEARER'S NEXT TURN: that is
                 the build's behaviour, not a penalty this tool invented.
  --armour <n>   give both fighters a breastplate and helmet of this grade
                 (default 0, no armour). SS2 subtracts damage from armour
                 first and carries only the overflow into health.
